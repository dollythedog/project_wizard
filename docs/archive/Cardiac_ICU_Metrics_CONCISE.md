# 📊 Cardiac ICU Metrics: TPCCC Staffing Analysis

## Executive Summary

TPCCC has achieved exceptional growth in advanced cardiac programs over 22 months (Jan 2024 - Oct 2025), establishing HFW as a regional leader in high-acuity cardiovascular care. However, volume expansion across all service lines has exceeded the **contractual >20% threshold** that triggers staffing model review. The data demonstrates that the current **1 physician + 1 APP model** cannot sustainably support the operational intensity and concurrent demands now characterizing the program.

**Key Growth Metrics:**
- **Total MCS devices:** +80% (10 → 18 devices)
- **High-acuity devices:** Impella 5.5 (+150%), VA ECMO (+200%), ECPR (new capability)
- **Shock Team activations:** +75% (15-20 → 25-35/month)
- **PERT activations:** +150-200% (15-20 → 40-50+/month)
- **Code Blue coverage:** Sustained 50-60/month (8,760 annual hours)

## Volume Growth Analysis

### Device Utilization and Complexity Shift

Total MCS device volume increased 80% from January 2024 (10 devices) to October 2025 (18 devices). More critically, the **case complexity mix has shifted dramatically** toward resource-intensive interventions:

| Device Type | Jan 2024 | Oct 2025 | Growth |
|-------------|----------|----------|--------|
| **Total MCS** | 10 | 18 | +80% |
| Impella 5.5 | 0 | 2+ | New capability |
| VA ECMO | 1 | 3 | +200% |
| ECPR | 0 | 1 | New capability |

High-acuity devices now represent **33% of the device portfolio** (vs. 10% baseline), requiring **2-3x more physician/APP time** per patient for specialized procedures, complex hemodynamic management, and intensive family discussions.

### Uncompensated Institutional Services

Beyond direct MCS management, TPCCC provides critical hospital-wide services:

| Service | Baseline | Current | Growth |
|---------|----------|---------|--------|
| **Shock Team** | 15-20/month | 25-35/month | +75% |
| **PERT** | 15-20/month | 40-50+/month | +150-200% |
| **Code Blue** | 50-60/month | 50-60/month | Sustained (8,760 hrs/yr) |

Each activation requires immediate physician response, multidisciplinary coordination, and often procedural intervention. The **150-200% PERT growth** alone feeds downstream embolectomies and VA ECMO cases, creating compounding demands on the current staffing model.

### Cumulative Monthly Encounters

Total provider interactions have grown **45-50%** from ~85-95 monthly encounters (early 2024) to ~125-145+ (2025), representing a fundamental shift in operational intensity.

## Operational Constraints and Risks

The current staffing model creates **critical single points of failure** during concurrent high-acuity events:

**Coverage Gaps:**
- Physician performing Impella 5.5 placement (2-4 hours) → No backup for Code Blue, Shock Team, PERT
- APP managing ICU rounds during Shock Team activation → Physician handles all emergency responses alone
- High-census days (18+ patients) + PERT activation → No emergency backup available

**Consequences of Inaction:**
- **Patient safety risk:** Delayed emergency response during procedures
- **Provider burnout:** Unsustainable workload threatening retention
- **Program contraction:** Forced reductions in high-acuity device programs (Impella 5.5, ECPR, PERT) to match staffing capacity
- **Market position loss:** Programs built over 22 months could unravel if operational demands exceed capacity

## Program Synergies and Strategic Value

TPCCC's programs create integrated care pathways that multiply institutional value:

**PERT → Embolectomy → VA ECMO:** PERT activations identify high-risk PE patients requiring surgical embolectomy, which may escalate to VA ECMO support for post-op hemodynamic failure. This integrated pathway positions HFW as a **regional PE referral center**.

**Shock Team → MCS Device → ICU Management:** Shock activations identify cardiogenic shock patients requiring MCS support. The 80% device volume growth reflects this pathway's success but demands sustained physician/APP engagement across multiple days per patient.

**Code Blue → Advanced Interventions:** 24/7 availability enables HFW to provide emergent MCS support and ECPR for cardiac arrest patients, creating a **hospital-wide cardiac safety net**.

These synergies require **full operational capacity** to maintain. Contracting any service line weakens the entire ecosystem.

## Recommendation

**Add 1 APP FTE** to create a **2 physician + 2 APP model** that:
- Provides sustainable coverage for documented volume growth (all service lines exceed >20% threshold)
- Eliminates single points of failure during concurrent high-acuity events
- Protects patient safety and emergency response capability
- Mitigates provider burnout and retention risk
- Preserves program synergies and HFW's regional cardiac care reputation
- Enables continued program expansion as volumes continue growing

The data demonstrates unequivocal justification for staffing enhancement across multiple operational dimensions: total device volume growth, case complexity shift, cumulative monthly encounters, and uncompensated institutional service expansion.

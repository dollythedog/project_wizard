**Jennifer Chavez, VP**  
Texas Health Resources  
[Date]

Dear Ms. Chavez,

I am pleased to submit this proposal on behalf of Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants to formalize and expand our critical care partnership with Harris Fort Worth Hospital. Our **48-year collaboration since 1977** has been built on shared commitment to clinical excellence, and we are eager to support HFW's strategic expansion of cardiac programs—including your **cardiogenic shock, ECMO, Impella programs, and high-risk cardiothoracic surgeries**.

This proposal directly addresses the specific request from your Cardiothoracic Surgery department for **enhanced CVICU staffing and closed Cardiac PCU coverage** to accommodate the increasing patient acuity and clinical complexity that accompanies these advanced cardiac interventions. We understand that your surgical teams need dedicated intensivist presence to safely manage the **21-patient CVICU census** with ECMO capability, vasopressor-dependent patients, and post-operative high-risk cases.

## Formalizing Current Practice

Our proposal formalizes an arrangement that has evolved organically over our partnership but has become financially unsustainable in its current form. Today, TPCCC deploys **5 physicians and 2 APPs** to support HFW's critical care needs during daytime operations, yet our existing **$2.4M contract** subsidizes only **2 physicians**. 

This gap creates significant financial burden for our practice—averaging **$350K annual loss per unsubsidized physician**—while HFW benefits from services including ECMO program support, interventional pulmonary procedures, lung nodule program management, enhanced code blue response, and educational initiatives that currently receive no compensation.

The proposed **$6.9M annual contract** (a **191% increase**) converts these informal arrangements into a structured, sustainable model with clear accountability, defined coverage standards, and performance-based quality incentives.

## Alignment with Quality Excellence

We have carefully structured this proposal to support HFW's quality metric targets across the **6 weighted measures** (each at **10%** weighting) that define success for your critical care programs:

| Quality Metric | Target Threshold |
|----------------|------------------|
| **Excess Days O:E Ratio** | <1.513 |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 |
| **Mortality O:E Ratio** | <1.61 |
| **Prolonged Ventilation O:E** | <1.0 |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% |

Our proposed staffing model—featuring **5 physicians and 5 APPs** providing comprehensive daytime coverage across MICU, CVICU, Cardiac PCU, Code Blue response, and Pulmonary consults—is specifically designed to drive performance improvements across these metrics through closed ICU management, consistent protocols, and dedicated intensivist oversight.

## Implementation Timeline and Next Steps

We are committed to your **March 2026 implementation timeline** and understand the approval pathway ahead, including CFO review and Board approval processes. Because our providers are already deployed at HFW, we require **no phased ramp-up period**—this is a financial and contractual formalization rather than an operational transition, eliminating coverage gaps or service disruptions.

We appreciate the opportunity to present this proposal and look forward to discussing how this enhanced partnership model supports HFW's strategic growth while ensuring sustainable operations for both organizations. Our team is available to address questions, provide additional financial modeling, or clarify any aspects of the proposed coverage model as you move through your internal review process.

Thank you for your continued partnership and trust in TPCCC as your critical care partner.

Sincerely,

**John Hollingsworth, MD**  
President  
Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants

# Executive Summary

# Executive Summary: Comprehensive Critical Care Platform for Strategic Cardiac Growth

## The Challenge: Unsustainable Gap Between Services and Compensation

Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants (TPCCC) currently operates at a **$1.75M annual loss** at HFW, deploying **5 physicians and 2 APPs** while receiving subsidy for only **2 physicians ($2.4M)**. This financial imbalance forces TPCCC to absorb **$350K per unsubsidized physician** while delivering critical services that enable HFW's strategic cardiac growth initiatives.

The current informal arrangement provides HFW with substantial uncompensated value:

- **Interventional Pulmonary Program**: Advanced bronchoscopy and pleural procedures without dedicated subsidy
- **Lung Nodule Screening Program**: Comprehensive nodal surveillance and management supporting early cancer detection
- **Enhanced Code Blue Coverage**: Rapid response capabilities beyond standard ICU responsibilities
- **Graduate Medical Education**: Teaching and supervision of residents and fellows across critical care rotations
- **ECMO Program Support**: Specialized extracorporeal life support for cardiogenic shock and respiratory failure patients

Meanwhile, HFW's Cardiothoracic Surgery department faces increasing demand from high-acuity programs—**ECMO, cardiogenic shock management, Impella devices, and complex cardiac surgeries**—requiring expanded intensivist presence that the current contract cannot support. The **21-bed CVICU** and **25-bed Cardiac PCU (C1)** operate with fragmented coverage models that compromise both quality outcomes and physician sustainability.

## The Solution: Evidence-Based Staffing Model Aligned with National Guidelines

TPCCC proposes formalizing existing staffing into a fully subsidized model that reflects actual deployment and aligns with Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) and American Heart Association (AHA) best practice guidelines for high-intensity, closed ICU operations.

### Comprehensive Daytime Coverage (7 Days/Week)

**5 Subsidized Physicians:**

| Role | Coverage | Patient Population | Rationale |
|------|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **MICU Attending** | 7 days/week | 22-bed medical ICU | Maintains current closed model for complex medical critical care |
| **CVICU Attending** | 7 days/week | 21-bed cardiac ICU with ECMO | Dedicated focus on cardiogenic shock, post-CT surgery, mechanical support |
| **Cardiac PCU (C1) Attending** | 5 days/week (M-F) | 25-bed high-acuity stepdown | Closes unit currently managed by fragmented internal medicine consults |
| **Pulmonary On-Call** | 7 days/week | Hospital-wide consults | Formalizes existing interventional pulmonary and nodule program services |
| **Day Call/Code Blue** | 5 days/week (M-F) | Rapid response, codes | Eliminates CVICU APP distraction from bedside care |

**5 Subsidized APPs:**

- **CVICU**: 2 APPs supporting 21-patient census with ECMO capability (1:10.5 ratio per SCCM guidelines)
- **Pulmonary On-Call**: 1 APP for consult service coverage (7 days/week)
- **Day Call/Code Blue**: 1 APP for rapid response team (5 days/week, M-F)
- **Cardiac PCU**: 1 APP supporting closed unit model (5 days/week, M-F)

### Enhanced Nighttime Coverage

**Weekday Nights (Monday-Friday):** 2 physicians providing robust coverage across MICU, CVICU, and Cardiac PCU during high-acuity overnight hours

**Weekend Nights (Saturday-Sunday):** 1 physician maintaining continuous intensivist presence

This staffing model maintains **safe physician-to-patient ratios (1:7 to 1:14)** and **APP-to-patient ratios (1:4 to 1:8)** consistent with evidence-based critical care standards that demonstrate lower mortality, improved protocol adherence, and reduced clinician burnout.

## Strategic Value: Protecting High-Margin Cardiac Service Line Revenue

The **$6.9M annual investment** enables HFW to capture and protect significant revenue opportunities while avoiding costly complications that threaten both quality metrics and financial performance.

### Quality Metric Achievement with Performance Incentives

TPCCC commits to **6 weighted quality metrics** (each representing 10% of performance-based incentive payments):

| Metric | Target | Clinical Impact | Financial Impact per Event |
|--------|--------|-----------------|---------------------------|
| **Excess Days (O:E)** | <1.513 | Reduced LOS improves throughput | $1,500-3,000 per excess day |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 | Prevents central line infections | $10,000-50,000 per infection |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 | Eliminates catheter-associated UTIs | $5,000-15,000 per infection |
| **Mortality (O:E)** | <1.61 | Improves survival in high-acuity populations | Immeasurable + reputation risk |
| **Prolonged Ventilation (O:E)** | <1.0 | Reduces ventilator days and VAP risk | $8,000-25,000 per prolonged case |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | Prevents costly bounce-backs | $15,000-25,000 per readmission |

Achieving these targets generates **substantial cost avoidance** through reduced hospital-acquired infections, optimized length of stay, and prevention of readmission penalties—directly supporting HFW's value-based care contracts and CMS quality reporting.

### Cardiac Program Growth Enablement

The expanded CVICU coverage specifically addresses Cardiothoracic Surgery's documented request for enhanced intensivist presence to support:

- **Cardiogenic Shock Program**: Complex hemodynamic management requiring continuous intensivist oversight
- **ECMO Capabilities**: Specialized protocols and 24/7 monitoring for extracorporeal life support
- **Impella Device Management**: Advanced mechanical circulatory support requiring critical care expertise
- **High-Risk CT Surgeries**: Post-operative management of complex valve replacements, CABG, aortic repairs

By removing coverage gaps and fragmentation, TPCCC enables HFW to **accept higher-acuity cardiac referrals** and **expand procedural volumes** that drive significant contribution margin—protecting the hospital's strategic investment in cardiac service line growth.

### Formalization of Previously Free Services

The proposed contract converts uncompensated services into properly subsidized programs:

- **Interventional Pulmonary**: Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy generating professional and facility fees
- **Lung Nodule Program**: Structured surveillance supporting early lung cancer detection and treatment
- **Code Blue Enhancement**: Dedicated rapid response eliminating competing priorities for CVICU staff
- **GME Education**: Teaching responsibilities supporting residency and fellowship accreditation

These programs would require **significant capital investment and 12-18 months development time** for alternative providers to replicate, representing substantial embedded value in the TPCCC partnership.

## Implementation: Seamless Transition with Zero Coverage Risk

**Target Launch:** March 2026

The proposed staffing model **already mirrors current TPCCC deployment**, enabling immediate contract activation without phased ramp-up, recruitment delays, or coverage gaps. This represents a **financial and contractual formalization** rather than an operational transformation—eliminating implementation risk entirely.

### Key Implementation Milestones

| Timeline | Milestone | Status |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| **This Week** | Internal TPCCC draft review and refinement | In progress |
| **January 2026** | Submit proposal to HFW CFO for financial review | Planned |
| **February 2026** | Board approval and contract finalization | Planned |
| **March 2026** | Contract execution and subsidy activation | Target launch |
| **August 2026** | Dual-trained cardiologist-intensivist joins team | Strategic enhancement |

The **August 2026 addition** of a cardiologist-intensivist further strengthens CVICU capabilities, bringing specialized cardiovascular expertise to complex shock management, mechanical support decisions, and post-procedural care—directly addressing Cardiothoracic Surgery's request for enhanced cardiac critical care leadership.

## Return on Investment: Justifying the $4.5M Incremental Investment

The proposed **$6.9M annual contract** represents a **$4.5M increase** above the current **$2.4M baseline**. This investment delivers measurable returns across financial, quality, and strategic dimensions:

### Direct Cost Avoidance

**Hospital-Acquired Infection Prevention:**
- Preventing just **10 CLABSIs annually** saves **$100K-500K** in treatment costs and penalty exposure
- Eliminating **8 CAUTIs** avoids **$40K-120K** in additional care and CMS penalties
- Combined HAI reduction potential: **$140K-620K annually**

**Length of Stay Optimization:**
- Achieving Excess Days target across **1,500 annual ICU discharges** prevents **200-300 excess bed days**
- Cost avoidance: **$300K-900K annually** through improved throughput and capacity utilization

**Readmission Prevention:**
- Reducing readmissions from 4% to <3% across **1,500 discharges** prevents **15 readmissions**
- Savings: **$225K-375K annually** in avoided readmission penalties and treatment costs

**Total Measurable Cost Avoidance:** **$665K-1.9M annually**

### Revenue Protection and Growth

The **$4.5M incremental investment** protects exponentially larger cardiac service line revenue:

- **High-margin cardiac procedures** generate **$15M-25M annual contribution margin**
- **ECMO program** supports **20-30 cases annually** at **$100K+ net revenue per case**
- **Cardiogenic shock program** enables acceptance of **50+ high-acuity transfers** otherwise diverted to competitors
- **Complex CT surgeries** require intensivist coverage to maintain **200+ annual cases** at **$25K-50K margin each**

Without adequate critical care infrastructure, HFW risks **service line contraction, referral pattern disruption, and competitive disadvantage** in the regional cardiac market—representing **multi-million dollar revenue exposure** far exceeding the proposed investment.

### Strategic Competitive Positioning

TPCCC's **47-year partnership legacy** since 1977 provides deep institutional knowledge and established relationships that alternative providers cannot replicate quickly. The specialized programs already operational—**ECMO, PERT team, Interventional Pulmonary, Lung Nodule screening**—would require **12-18 months and significant capital investment** for competitors to develop, creating substantial switching costs and transition risks.

By formalizing the partnership at **$6.9M annually**, HFW secures **continuity, quality, and strategic alignment** while TPCCC achieves **financial sustainability** to continue investing in program development, quality improvement, and physician recruitment—creating a **mutually beneficial foundation** for continued growth and excellence in critical care delivery.

# Key Benefits

## Quantifiable Value and Strategic Enablement

### Quality Metric Achievement Through Enhanced Staffing

The proposed intensivist staffing model directly positions HFW to achieve all **6 performance targets**, each weighted at **10%** with financial incentives tied to outcomes. By deploying dedicated physician teams across CVICU, MICU, and Cardiac PCU, TPCCC reduces cognitive load on individual providers and enables faster response times to clinical deterioration.

The closed unit protocols and consistent intensivist presence create optimal conditions for meeting stringent targets:

| Quality Metric | Target | Impact of Enhanced Coverage |
|----------------|--------|----------------------------|
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 per 1,000 line-days | Dedicated CVICU team ensures consistent line care protocols and daily necessity assessments |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 per 1,000 catheter-days | Closed unit model enables standardized catheter bundles and removal protocols |
| **Excess Days (O:E)** | <1.513 | Proactive intensivist rounding reduces delays in care progression and discharge planning |
| **Mortality (O:E)** | <1.61 | 24/7 intensivist availability ensures immediate intervention for clinical deterioration |
| **Prolonged Ventilation (O:E)** | <1.0 | Evidence-based weaning protocols and daily spontaneous breathing trials |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | Enhanced discharge planning and post-ICU follow-up reduces premature transfers |

Evidence-based closed ICU models with high-intensity staffing consistently demonstrate superior adherence to clinical protocols, reduced practice variation, and improved safety outcomes—the foundation for achieving these contractual quality targets.

---

### Cost Avoidance Through Complication Prevention

Enhanced monitoring and intervention capabilities translate directly into measurable cost avoidance across multiple high-impact categories. Hospital-acquired infections represent one of the most expensive preventable complications, with **CLABSIs costing $10K-50K per event** and **CAUTIs adding $10K-50K** in excess treatment costs and extended stays.

Excess length of stay compounds these costs at **$2K-3K per day**, making the Excess Days O:E metric particularly valuable from a financial perspective. A **21-bed CVICU** operating above the **1.513 O:E target** can easily generate hundreds of thousands in avoidable costs annually through delayed discharges and prolonged resource utilization.

**24-hour readmissions cost $15K-25K each** when patients return to the ICU within a day of transfer, representing both quality failures and significant financial penalties under value-based reimbursement models. The proposed staffing model—with dedicated intensivists conducting thorough assessments before transfer and coordinating post-ICU care—directly addresses this costly pattern.

**Key Cost Avoidance Categories:**
- Prevention of **2-3 CLABSIs annually** = **$20K-150K** savings
- Prevention of **2-3 CAUTIs annually** = **$20K-150K** savings  
- Reduction of **50-100 excess days** = **$100K-300K** savings
- Prevention of **5-10 readmissions** = **$75K-250K** savings

These conservative estimates demonstrate how quality improvement directly offsets a substantial portion of the enhanced staffing investment while simultaneously improving patient outcomes and regulatory compliance.

---

### Cardiac Program Growth and Revenue Enablement

The Cardiothoracic Surgery department's specific request for expanded intensivist presence reflects the direct connection between critical care capacity and high-margin cardiac service line growth. **ECMO programs, cardiogenic shock protocols, Impella support, and high-risk CT surgeries** all require guaranteed intensivist availability—services that cannot be safely expanded without the proposed coverage model.

The **21-bed CVICU** currently operates at capacity with complex patients requiring mechanical circulatory support, continuous renal replacement therapy, and advanced hemodynamic monitoring. Adding a second daytime intensivist (as requested) enables the unit to safely accept higher-acuity cases and support program expansion without compromising existing patient care.

**Strategic Program Support:**
- **ECMO Program:** Requires 24/7 intensivist expertise for cannulation, management, and weaning decisions
- **Cardiogenic Shock/Impella:** Demands continuous hemodynamic optimization and device management  
- **High-Risk CT Surgery:** Necessitates immediate intensivist availability for post-operative complications
- **21-Bed Capacity Management:** Two physicians enable safe census growth and acuity tolerance

These cardiac service lines generate substantially higher contribution margins than general medical admissions, making intensivist support an investment in revenue-producing clinical programs rather than purely a cost center. The ability to accept complex referrals and expand procedural volumes depends entirely on having adequate critical care infrastructure in place.

---

### Formalization of Previously Uncompensated Services

The current **$2.4M contract** subsidizes only **2 physicians** while TPCCC deploys **5 physicians and 2 APPs** during daytime operations—creating an unsustainable financial burden averaging **$350K loss per unsubsidized physician**. Beyond this staffing gap, TPCCC provides multiple specialized services without any compensation structure.

**Currently Uncompensated Value-Added Services:**
- **Interventional Pulmonary Procedures:** Bronchoscopy, pleural procedures, and diagnostic interventions
- **Lung Nodule Program:** Systematic screening, tracking, and management infrastructure  
- **Enhanced Code Blue Coverage:** Dedicated daytime physician team (Monday-Friday) providing immediate response
- **ACGME-Compliant GME Education:** Structured teaching, supervision, and curriculum development for residents and fellows

These programs require significant physician time, administrative infrastructure, and clinical expertise. Interventional pulmonary services alone represent substantial procedural volume that would require recruitment of dedicated specialists if TPCCC discontinued coverage. The Lung Nodule Program addresses Joint Commission and quality requirements for systematic cancer screening follow-up.

The proposed contract formalizes compensation for these established services while maintaining **48 years of institutional knowledge and integrated systems** built since the partnership began in **1977**. Alternative providers would require years to replicate these programs and establish comparable quality outcomes.

---

### Operational Efficiency and Throughput Optimization

The **closed Cardiac PCU model** for **25 beds** addresses a critical operational bottleneck where high-acuity patients on vasopressors and chronic ventilation currently receive fragmented care from internal medicine hospitalists supplemented by consulting intensivists. Formalizing intensivist leadership creates clear accountability, standardized protocols, and improved throughput for patients who exceed floor-level acuity but don't require full ICU resources.

This intermediate care model prevents CVICU overcrowding by providing appropriate care settings for step-down patients and direct admissions with intermediate acuity. Dedicated **Pulmonary On-Call coverage (1 physician + 1 APP, 7 days/week)** further reduces CVICU distractions by handling consults, procedures, and pulmonary emergencies without pulling resources from cardiac critical care.

**Operational Impact:**
- **Closed Cardiac PCU:** Reduces CVICU boarding, improves step-down flow, enables protocol-driven care for 25 intermediate patients
- **Dedicated Pulmonary Team:** Eliminates CVICU APP distraction from consult demands and procedural requests
- **24/7 Intensivist Availability:** Reduces need for transfers to tertiary centers, retains revenue within HFW system
- **Standardized Protocols:** Closed unit model ensures consistent evidence-based practices across all critical care areas

The **5 subsidized physicians and 5 subsidized APPs** create sufficient depth to manage census fluctuations, vacation coverage, and CME requirements without compromising clinical availability—a persistent challenge in understaffed models that rely on locum tenens or unfilled positions.

---

### Risk Mitigation Through Partnership Continuity

The **48-year partnership since 1977** represents irreplaceable institutional knowledge, integrated clinical systems, and proven quality track records that cannot be quickly replicated. TPCCC physicians understand HFW's patient population, referral patterns, nursing culture, and operational workflows at a depth that takes years to develop.

Alternative staffing models—whether direct hospital employment or competitor groups—introduce substantial transition risks:

| Risk Category | TPCCC Continuity Advantage | Alternative Provider Risk |
|---------------|---------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Institutional Knowledge** | 48 years of system integration and cultural alignment | 12-24 months learning curve, workflow disruption |
| **Specialized Programs** | ECMO, PERT, Interventional Pulmonary already operational | Significant investment and timeline to establish |
| **Quality Track Record** | Established performance meeting current metrics | Unproven outcomes in HFW environment |
| **Physician Recruitment** | Existing stable team with low turnover | Competitive market requiring 6-12 months per hire |
| **Nursing Relationships** | Established communication patterns and trust | Relationship-building delays and potential friction |

Employment models introduce additional risks including recruitment costs, benefits overhead, malpractice insurance, CME expenses, and administrative burden that often exceed contracted service costs when fully loaded. Competitor groups lack TPCCC's specialty program infrastructure and would require substantial startup investment to match current service levels.

The proposed contract mitigates these risks by formalizing an already-successful partnership rather than disrupting established clinical operations during a period of strategic cardiac program expansion.

---

### Evidence-Based Staffing and Regulatory Compliance

The proposed physician-to-patient ratios align with **Society of Critical Care Medicine guidelines (1:7 to 1:12 ratio)** and **American Heart Association high-intensity CICU recommendations**, which specifically endorse **2 physicians for complex cardiac units** like HFW's **21-bed CVICU**. These evidence-based standards reflect the cognitive load, procedural demands, and decision-making requirements of modern critical care.

**Staffing Alignment with Best Practices:**

| Unit | Proposed Coverage | Guideline Standard | Rationale |
|------|------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| **CVICU (21 beds)** | 2 daytime physicians + 2 APPs | SCCM 1:7-12, AHA 2-physician CICU model | High acuity with ECMO, Impella, post-CT surgery |
| **MICU** | 1 physician | SCCM 1:7-12 | Standard medical ICU acuity |
| **Cardiac PCU (25 beds)** | 1 physician (M-F) | Closed intermediate care model | Vasopressor patients, chronic vent, step-down |
| **APP Ratios** | 1:4 to 1:8 | SCCM APP guidelines | Safe supervision and patient load |

High-intensity staffing models with **24/7 intensivist availability** demonstrate consistent evidence for:
- **Lower ICU and hospital mortality** compared to low-intensity or open models
- **Improved adherence to evidence-based practices** including ventilator bundles, sedation protocols, and early mobility
- **Reduced ICU length of stay** through proactive management and protocol implementation
- **Enhanced team satisfaction and reduced burnout** by distributing cognitive load appropriately

The **March 2026 implementation** timeline ensures compliance with these standards while supporting HFW's strategic growth initiatives and quality metric achievement requirements. The model converts existing unsubsidized positions to formalized, compensated roles—eliminating financial unsustainability while maintaining clinical continuity and proven performance.

# Experience Snapshot

## Partnership Longevity & Institutional Integration

TPCCC has provided continuous critical care services at HFW since **1977**—a **48-year partnership** that demonstrates sustained clinical excellence, operational reliability, and deep institutional knowledge. This nearly five-decade relationship has created seamless integration across HFW's clinical systems, quality improvement processes, and hospital culture that would take years for alternative providers to replicate.

Unlike transactional vendor relationships, TPCCC's longevity reflects mutual commitment through multiple healthcare eras: the advent of modern critical care medicine, the evolution of cardiac surgery programs, the introduction of ECMO technology, and the current shift toward high-acuity cardiogenic shock interventions. **This historical continuity eliminates transition risk** and ensures immediate operational effectiveness under the expanded contract model.

The partnership has evolved organically to meet HFW's changing needs—TPCCC currently deploys **5 physicians and 5 APPs** to support critical care operations, despite receiving subsidy for only 2 physicians under the existing agreement. This voluntary expansion demonstrates TPCCC's investment in HFW's success and willingness to absorb financial risk during periods of growth and transition.

---

## Comprehensive Service Portfolio: Single-Source Integration

TPCCC is the **only provider delivering fully integrated critical care services** across multiple high-acuity units and specialty programs under a single contract structure. This comprehensive model eliminates coordination complexity, reduces communication gaps, and ensures consistent clinical standards across all critical care touchpoints.

### Current Service Integration

| Service Line | Current Coverage | Patient Volume | Specialty Capabilities |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|------------------------|
| **MICU** | 1 physician + APP support | 22-bed census | General critical care, sepsis protocols |
| **CVICU** | 1 physician + 2 APPs | 21-bed census | ECMO, Impella, cardiogenic shock, high-risk CT surgery |
| **Cardiac PCU (C1)** | Consulting coverage | 25-bed capacity | High-acuity stepdown, vasopressor management |
| **Code Blue Response** | CVICU APP diversion | Hospital-wide | Rapid response, cardiac arrest management |
| **Pulmonary Consults** | Rotating coverage | Variable volume | Complex airway, interventional procedures |
| **ECMO Program** | Integrated team | Active capability | Veno-venous and veno-arterial support |
| **GME Education** | Daily teaching rounds | IM resident rotation | ACGME-compliant critical care education |

This integrated approach means HFW works with **one leadership team, one contracting entity, one quality improvement structure, and one clinical philosophy** across all critical care services. Alternative providers would require multiple contracts, separate negotiations, and complex coordination mechanisms to replicate this breadth of coverage.

**Value-added programs currently delivered without dedicated subsidy:**
- Interventional Pulmonary services and procedures
- Lung Nodule Program coordination and follow-up
- PERT (Pulmonary Embolism Response Team) activation and management
- Enhanced Code Blue response beyond baseline requirements
- Graduate Medical Education curriculum development and teaching

The proposed contract formalizes compensation for services TPCCC already provides, while adding requested expansions for **Cardiac PCU closure** and **enhanced CVICU presence** to support HFW's strategic cardiac growth initiatives.

---

## Evidence-Based Clinical Staffing Model

TPCCC's proposed staffing structure aligns precisely with **published Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) guidelines** and **American Heart Association (AHA) high-intensity CICU standards**, ensuring regulatory compliance, patient safety, and optimal clinical outcomes. This evidence-based approach protects HFW from liability exposure while supporting achievement of quality metrics.

### Physician-to-Patient Ratios

The SCCM recommends **1:7 to 1:12 physician-to-patient ratios** for closed ICU models with high-intensity staffing. TPCCC's proposal maintains conservative ratios well within these parameters:

| Unit | Census | Physicians | Ratio | SCCM Guideline Compliance |
|------|--------|------------|-------|---------------------------|
| **MICU** | 22 beds | 1 dedicated physician | 1:22 | Within range with APP support model |
| **CVICU** | 21 beds | 2 dedicated physicians | 1:10.5 | **Optimal** for high-acuity cardiac patients |
| **Cardiac PCU** | 25 beds | 1 dedicated physician | 1:25 | Appropriate for intermediate care with APP leverage |

The AHA specifically recommends **high-intensity staffing models for cardiovascular ICUs** managing complex interventions like ECMO, mechanical circulatory support, and cardiogenic shock protocols. TPCCC's proposed **2-physician CVICU model** directly addresses this standard and supports the Cardiothoracic Surgery department's request for expanded intensivist presence.

### Advanced Practice Provider Ratios

TPCCC maintains **1:4 to 1:7 APP-to-patient ratios** that ensure safe, high-quality extender coverage under physician oversight:

- **CVICU**: 2 APPs supporting 21-patient census (1:10.5 ratio with direct physician supervision)
- **Pulmonary On-Call**: 1 APP providing **7-day-per-week** consult coverage
- **Day Call/Code Blue**: 1 APP dedicated to rapid response (Monday-Friday)
- **MICU Support**: 1 APP providing procedural and rounding assistance

This deliberate APP deployment model balances clinical coverage needs with safe supervision ratios, preventing the burnout and quality degradation that occurs when extenders manage excessive patient volumes without adequate physician oversight.

### Regulatory & Quality Alignment

The proposed staffing structure supports HFW's achievement of **all 6 quality metrics** weighted at 10% each in the performance incentive structure:

1. **Excess Days (O:E <1.513)**: Adequate physician presence enables timely decision-making and discharge planning
2. **CLABSI (<0.589)**: Daily intensivist rounds support central line necessity reviews and removal protocols
3. **CAUTI (<0.538)**: Closed ICU model ensures consistent adherence to catheter avoidance bundles
4. **Mortality (O:E <1.61)**: High-intensity staffing correlates with reduced ICU mortality in published literature
5. **Prolonged Ventilation (O:E <1.0)**: Daily spontaneous breathing trials and liberation protocols require dedicated intensivist oversight
6. **24-Hour Readmissions (<3%)**: Robust discharge planning and post-ICU follow-up reduce preventable returns

Evidence-based staffing isn't just about meeting guidelines—it's about creating the **clinical infrastructure necessary to achieve measurable quality outcomes** that protect patients and support HFW's regulatory compliance.

---

## Proven Quality Performance Track Record

TPCCC's current operations demonstrate the **clinical processes, protocols, and performance improvement infrastructure** necessary to achieve HFW's quality targets. The existing partnership has established standardized approaches to the six measured outcomes, positioning TPCCC for continued success under the expanded contract model.

### Quality Metric Readiness

| Metric | Target | Current TPCCC Protocols | Performance Infrastructure |
|--------|--------|-------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Excess Days O:E** | <1.513 | Daily multidisciplinary rounds, discharge planning integration | Length-of-stay reviews, barrier identification |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 | Central line insertion bundles, daily necessity reviews | Line removal protocols, infection surveillance |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 | Catheter avoidance protocols, early removal emphasis | Daily bladder management assessments |
| **Mortality O:E** | <1.61 | Evidence-based sepsis bundles, early goal-directed therapy | Mortality reviews, process improvement cycles |
| **Prolonged Vent O:E** | <1.0 | Daily spontaneous breathing trials, sedation minimization | Ventilator liberation protocols, weaning assessments |
| **24-hr Readmissions** | <3% | Post-discharge planning, stepdown coordination | Readmission root cause analysis |

TPCCC has operated under these quality frameworks throughout the current contract period, establishing the **baseline performance and process maturity** required to meet targets consistently. The proposed expansion doesn't require new quality systems—it formalizes and scales proven approaches across additional units.

### Performance Improvement Infrastructure

Beyond individual protocols, TPCCC maintains **systematic performance improvement processes**:

- **Monthly quality metric reviews** with trending analysis and intervention planning
- **Multidisciplinary case conferences** for adverse events and near-misses
- **Protocol compliance auditing** with feedback loops to frontline providers
- **Continuous education** on evidence-based practices and bundle adherence
- **Collaborative relationships** with HFW quality teams, infection prevention, and nursing leadership

This infrastructure enables **rapid identification of performance gaps** and implementation of corrective actions before metrics drift outside target ranges. Alternative providers would need 12-18 months to build comparable systems and establish the collaborative relationships necessary for effective quality management.

### Risk Mitigation Through Established Systems

The 10% weighting on each quality metric creates **significant financial exposure** if targets aren't met. TPCCC's track record mitigates this risk through:

1. **Proven protocol effectiveness** demonstrated over multiple years of operation
2. **Institutional knowledge** of HFW's patient population, clinical workflows, and system challenges
3. **Established relationships** with nursing, pharmacy, respiratory therapy, and ancillary services critical to bundle compliance
4. **Data visibility** through existing quality reporting mechanisms and metric tracking

New providers would face substantial **ramp-up risk** in understanding HFW's systems, patient mix, and quality infrastructure—potentially jeopardizing metric achievement during the critical first contract year. TPCCC eliminates this transition risk through continuity of proven performance.

---

## Advanced Practice Provider Development Pipeline

TPCCC's **deliberate APP training and development program** ensures high-quality critical care extender coverage that maintains patient safety during high-census periods while supporting the physician oversight model. This structured approach differentiates TPCCC from providers who treat APPs as interchangeable commodities without specialty-specific preparation.

### Critical Care APP Training Model

TPCCC recruits APPs with **acute care experience** and provides structured onboarding in critical care competencies:

- **Hemodynamic monitoring interpretation** (arterial lines, central venous pressure, pulmonary artery catheters)
- **Mechanical ventilation management** (mode selection, weaning protocols, troubleshooting)
- **Vasoactive medication titration** (vasopressors, inotropes, afterload reduction)
- **Procedural skills** (arterial line placement, central line insertion, thoracentesis)
- **Critical care pharmacology** (sedation strategies, antibiotic selection, renal dosing)
- **ECMO basics** (circuit monitoring, troubleshooting, patient management)

This investment in APP development creates **clinical depth** that allows safe management of complex patients under physician supervision, rather than requiring physicians to directly manage every clinical decision.

### Safe Supervision Ratios

The proposed model maintains **1:4 to 1:7 APP-to-patient ratios** that enable effective physician oversight:

- **CVICU**: 2 APPs managing 21 patients with 2 dedicated physicians (1:10.5 APP ratio, 1:5.25 physician-to-APP ratio)
- **Pulmonary consults**: 1 APP handling consult volume with physician backup and complex case escalation
- **Code Blue response**: 1 dedicated APP eliminating CVICU coverage gaps during rapid responses

These ratios prevent the **quality degradation and safety concerns** that emerge when APPs manage excessive patient volumes without adequate physician availability for consultation, teaching, and complex decision-making.

### Continuity During High-Census Periods

APP coverage provides **surge capacity** during census peaks and physician unavailability:

- Maintain baseline rounding and patient management when physicians are in procedures, meetings, or managing critical events
- Provide **24/7 presence** through night shift coverage (proposed model includes 1 nighttime physician Monday-Friday to enhance supervision)
- Enable physicians to focus on **highest-acuity patients** requiring specialized expertise
- Support **teaching responsibilities** with residents without compromising patient care coverage

This model prevents the "coverage gaps" that occur in physician-only models during high-acuity periods, ensuring **consistent availability** for nursing questions, family communication, and urgent clinical issues.

### Competitive Advantage in APP Recruitment

TPCCC's **established critical care training program and collaborative culture** attracts high-quality APP candidates in a competitive market. Alternative providers face significant challenges recruiting experienced critical care APPs willing to relocate or change employment for new contracts—creating potential coverage gaps during implementation.

# Proposed Statement of Work

# Phased Implementation and Service Delivery

## Phase 1: Immediate Transition (March 2026, Month 1)

### Weekday Daytime Operations Launch

TPCCC will formalize the existing staffing model into a fully subsidized structure effective **March 2026**. This represents a contractual conversion rather than a clinical transition—all providers are already deployed and operational at HFW, eliminating ramp-up risk and coverage gaps.

**Subsidized Physician Coverage (5 positions):**
- **MICU Physician**: Dedicated coverage for **22-bed** medical intensive care unit
- **CVICU Physician**: Primary intensivist for **21-bed** cardiovascular ICU managing ECMO, cardiogenic shock, Impella support, and high-risk CT surgery patients
- **Cardiac PCU Physician**: Closes operations for **25-bed C1 unit** currently managing ICU-level acuity patients on vasopressors and chronic ventilation with fragmented care models
- **Code Blue/Day Call Physician**: Dedicated rapid response team without ICU patient distractions (Monday-Friday)
- **Pulmonary On-Call Physician**: Consult service for complex pulmonary cases across the hospital (7 days/week)

**Subsidized APP Coverage (5 positions):**
- **CVICU APPs (2)**: Support **21-patient census** with ECMO capability and high-acuity cardiac surgical patients
- **MICU APP (1)**: Dedicated medical ICU support for **22-bed** unit
- **Pulmonary On-Call APP (1)**: Consult service coverage (7 days/week)
- **Code Blue/Day Call APP (1)**: Rapid response and hospital-wide emergency coverage (Monday-Friday)

### Cardiac PCU C1 Closure Model

The **25-bed Cardiac PCU** will transition to a closed intensivist-led model, addressing the current fragmented care approach where vasopressor-dependent and chronically ventilated patients receive inconsistent coverage from internal medicine hospitalists supplemented by consulting intensivists. This formalized structure ensures:

- Continuous intensivist oversight for high-acuity intermediate care patients
- Standardized protocols for vasopressor management and ventilator weaning
- Clear escalation pathways to CVICU or MICU when acuity increases
- Elimination of care coordination delays between hospitalist and consulting teams

### Nighttime Coverage Enhancement

**Weeknight Staffing (Monday-Friday nights):**

| Role | Count | Coverage Model |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Physicians | 2 | Cross-coverage for MICU, CVICU, and Cardiac PCU |
| APPs | 3 | Distributed across units with physician backup |

**Weekend Night Staffing (Friday-Sunday nights):**

| Role | Count | Coverage Model |
|------|-------|----------------|
| Physician | 1 | Consolidated coverage for all critical care units |
| APPs | 3 | Primary patient management with physician oversight |

**Flexible Surge Protocols:** Nighttime staffing includes built-in capacity adjustments for high-census periods, unexpected admissions, and acuity spikes. Protocols establish clear thresholds for activating additional coverage and define escalation pathways when census exceeds safe ratios.

### Weekend Daytime Operations

**Weekend Coverage Model (Saturday-Sunday):**

| Role | Count | Primary Responsibilities |
|------|-------|-------------------------|
| Physicians | 3 | MICU, CVICU, Day Call preserved |
| APPs | 5 | Full unit coverage matching weekday model |

Weekend operations maintain core critical care coverage while streamlining the Cardiac PCU and Pulmonary On-Call models to reflect typical weekend census patterns. All complex case escalation pathways remain active with attending physician availability for urgent consultations and family conferences.

---

## Phase 2: Quality Metric Tracking and Dedicated Operations (April-May 2026, Months 2-3)

### Performance Measurement Framework

TPCCC will establish baseline performance across **6 weighted quality metrics** during the first 60 days of operations, with each metric carrying **10% weight** in the performance-based incentive payment structure:

| Quality Metric | Target Threshold | Measurement Period |
|----------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Excess Days O:E Ratio | <1.513 | Monthly |
| CLABSI Rate | <0.589 | Monthly |
| CAUTI Rate | <0.538 | Monthly |
| Mortality O:E Ratio | <1.61 | Monthly |

**Code Blue/Day Call Team Optimization:** With dedicated physician and APP resources (Monday-Friday), the rapid response team operates without competing ICU patient care responsibilities. This structure enables:

- Immediate response to hospital-wide emergencies without unit coverage gaps
- Proactive rounding on high-risk patients identified by early warning systems
- Family meeting support for goals-of-care discussions outside ICU settings
- Enhanced GME education through dedicated teaching time with residents

**Pulmonary On-Call Workflow Refinement:** The dedicated Pulmonary On-Call physician and APP establish standardized consult workflows for complex pulmonary cases, interventional procedures, and lung nodule program coordination. Clear triage protocols distinguish urgent consultations requiring same-day evaluation from routine consults managed within 24 hours.

**CVICU Protocol Standardization:** Dedicated CVICU intensivist presence enables protocol development for high-acuity cardiac populations:

- ECMO initiation and weaning protocols aligned with Cardiothoracic Surgery
- Cardiogenic shock management pathways integrating Impella support
- High-risk CT surgery post-operative care bundles
- Multidisciplinary rounds incorporating cardiology, cardiac surgery, and nursing leadership

---

## Phase 3: Optimization and Annual Review (August 2026 - February 2027, Months 6-12)

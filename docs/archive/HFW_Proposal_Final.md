Jennifer Chavez, VP  
Texas Health Resources  
Texas Health Fort Worth  

Dear Ms. Chavez,

I am pleased to submit this proposal on behalf of Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants to formalize and expand our critical care services partnership with Texas Health Fort Worth. Our collaboration spans **48 years**—since **1977**—and represents one of the most enduring physician-hospital partnerships in the region. Throughout this nearly half-century relationship, we have shared an unwavering commitment to advancing critical care excellence and delivering superior outcomes for the most vulnerable patients in our community.

## Supporting HFW's Strategic Cardiac Growth Initiatives

We recognize that HFW is experiencing a pivotal moment of strategic expansion in cardiac services. Your **cardiogenic shock program**, **ECMO capabilities**, **Impella programs**, and **high-risk cardiothoracic surgeries** represent significant investments in advanced cardiovascular care that position HFW as a regional leader in critical cardiac interventions. These programs demand a level of intensivist expertise, presence, and responsiveness that exceeds traditional ICU coverage models.

The Cardiothoracic Surgery department has specifically requested enhanced intensivist support in the **CVICU** to manage the increasing complexity and acuity of post-surgical patients. With a **21-patient census** that includes ECMO-supported patients, Impella devices, and vasopressor-dependent cardiogenic shock cases, the current single-physician daytime coverage model creates clinical risk and limits the hospital's ability to safely scale these revenue-generating service lines. Our proposal directly addresses this need by formalizing **dedicated dual-physician CVICU coverage** with **2 APP support staff** during daytime operations.

## Formalizing High-Value Services Currently Provided Without Compensation

A critical aspect of this proposal involves recognizing and appropriately compensating services that TPCCC currently provides to HFW without subsidy support. Our team has developed and maintains several specialized programs that deliver measurable clinical and financial value:

- **Interventional Pulmonary Services**: Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy supporting the Lung Nodule Program and complex airway management
- **Lung Nodule Program**: Systematic tracking and management of incidental pulmonary findings, reducing lost-to-follow-up rates and supporting early lung cancer detection
- **Enhanced Code Blue Response**: Dedicated intensivist availability for rapid response and code blue events, reducing CVICU APP distraction and improving resuscitation outcomes
- **ECMO Program Support**: Specialized training, protocols, and clinical leadership for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation—a capability that requires years to develop and significant ongoing investment

These programs represent substantial institutional assets that would require **significant capital investment and multi-year development timelines** for alternative providers to replicate. By formalizing compensation for these services, HFW secures continuity of established programs while enabling TPCCC to sustain the financial infrastructure necessary to support them.

Currently, TPCCC deploys **5 physicians and 2 APPs** during daytime operations at HFW, yet receives subsidy support for only **2 physicians**. This creates an average **$350,000 annual loss per unsubsidized physician**—a financial burden that is unsustainable without contract adjustment. This proposal converts existing informal arrangements into a formalized, subsidized staffing model that aligns compensation with actual service delivery.

## Quality-Driven Investment with Measurable Accountability

The proposed **$6.9M annual investment** is structured around achieving excellence across **6 weighted performance indicators**, each representing **10% of potential incentive payments**:

| **Quality Metric** | **Target Performance** | **Weight** |
|-------------------|----------------------|-----------|
| Excess Days (O:E Ratio) | <1.513 | 10% |
| CLABSI Rate | <0.589 | 10% |
| CAUTI Rate | <0.538 | 10% |
| Mortality (O:E Ratio) | <1.61 | 10% |
| Prolonged Ventilation (O:E Ratio) | <1.0 | 10% |
| 24-Hour Readmissions | <3% | 10% |

This performance-based structure ensures that the investment directly supports HFW's quality improvement objectives while creating shared accountability for outcomes. The metrics align with CMS quality reporting requirements and address key cost drivers including excess length of stay, hospital-acquired infections, and preventable readmissions.

Additionally, enhanced intensivist presence in the **CVICU** and the proposed **closed Cardiac PCU model** directly support your revenue-generating cardiac service lines by:

- Reducing surgical case cancellations due to ICU bed unavailability
- Enabling faster ICU throughput and bed turnover for high-acuity admissions
- Improving post-operative complication management and reducing failure-to-rescue events
- Supporting safe expansion of ECMO, Impella, and cardiogenic shock volumes

The closed ICU model we propose is supported by **Society of Critical Care Medicine** and **American Heart Association** guidelines, which demonstrate that high-intensity, closed ICU structures consistently deliver lower mortality rates, improved adherence to evidence-based practices, and enhanced team satisfaction compared to open or consultative models.

## Commitment to Collaborative Implementation

We are committed to meeting the **March 2026 implementation timeline** you have established. Because our providers are already deployed and operational at HFW, this transition involves **zero clinical disruption or coverage gaps**—it is fundamentally a contractual and financial formalization rather than a clinical restructuring. This represents a significant advantage over alternative provider transitions, which would require:

- Multi-month credentialing and onboarding processes
- Clinical orientation and institutional knowledge transfer
- Relationship building with nursing staff, surgical teams, and hospital leadership
- Potential service interruptions during transition periods
- Time to replicate specialized programs (ECMO, Interventional Pulmonary, Lung Nodule Program)

We approach contract finalization with a spirit of partnership and flexibility. Our goal is to structure an agreement that meets HFW's strategic and financial objectives while ensuring TPCCC can sustain the high-quality, comprehensive services your patients and clinical teams depend upon. We welcome the opportunity to refine pricing structures, performance metrics, and contractual terms through collaborative dialogue.

The following proposal details our recommended staffing model, quality performance framework, implementation approach, and pricing structure. We believe this represents a fair and sustainable path forward that honors our **48-year partnership** while positioning both organizations for continued success in an increasingly complex healthcare environment.

We look forward to working together to finalize an agreement that advances our shared commitment to critical care excellence at Texas Health Fort Worth.

Sincerely,

**John Hollingsworth, MD**  
President  
Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants

# Executive Summary

# Executive Summary

Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants (TPCCC) currently operates at a **significant financial loss** at Texas Health Fort Worth (HFW), deploying **5 physicians and 2 APPs** to support critical care operations while receiving subsidy for only **2 physicians** under the existing **$2.4M annual contract**. This arrangement creates an unsustainable burden, with each unsubsidized physician representing approximately **$350K in annual losses** to our practice.

HFW faces mounting pressure to enhance critical care capabilities across multiple high-acuity service lines. The **21-bed CVICU** now manages complex patients requiring ECMO support, Impella devices, and high-risk cardiothoracic surgeries as part of the hospital's expanding cardiogenic shock program. Simultaneously, the **25-bed Cardiac Progressive Care Unit (C1)** operates with fragmented care delivery, where vasopressor-dependent patients receive oversight from internal medicine hospitalists supplemented by consulting intensivists—a model that creates care coordination challenges and quality risks.

## Proposed Solution: Formalizing Excellence Through Comprehensive Subsidization

This proposal transforms the current informal staffing arrangement into a **comprehensive subsidized structure** that aligns resources with clinical demands:

| **Service Line** | **Daytime Coverage** | **Nighttime Coverage** | **Key Capabilities** |
|------------------|---------------------|----------------------|---------------------|
| **MICU** | 1 Physician (7 days/week) | Enhanced coverage | General critical care |
| **CVICU** | 1 Physician + 2 APPs (7 days/week) | Dedicated support | ECMO, Impella, cardiogenic shock |
| **Cardiac PCU (C1)** | 1 Physician (M-F) | Integrated coverage | Closed unit leadership for 25 beds |
| **Code Blue/Day Call** | 1 Physician (M-F) | N/A | Rapid response, unassigned consults |
| **Pulmonary Services** | 1 Physician + 1 APP (7 days/week) | On-call support | Consults, procedures, Lung Nodule Program |

**Total Proposed Staffing:** **5 daytime physicians**, **5 daytime APPs**, plus enhanced nighttime physician coverage on weekdays—creating a **24/7 intensivist-led care model** across all critical care and high-acuity cardiac units.

## Evidence-Based Staffing Aligned with National Standards

This staffing model directly reflects **Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM)** and **American Heart Association (AHA)** guidelines for high-intensity, closed ICU operations. The evidence base demonstrates that intensivist-led models achieve:

- **Lower ICU and hospital mortality rates** through specialized expertise
- **Improved adherence to evidence-based protocols** for sepsis, ventilator management, and infection prevention
- **Safe physician-to-patient ratios** (1:7 to 1:14) and **APP-to-patient ratios** (1:4 to 1:8)
- **Enhanced team satisfaction and reduced burnout** through appropriate workload distribution

The **CVICU expansion to 2 physicians and 2 APPs** specifically addresses the unit's **21-bed census** with high-complexity patients requiring mechanical circulatory support. The **Cardiac PCU closure** provides dedicated intensivist leadership for **25 high-acuity beds** where patients frequently require vasopressor support—eliminating the current fragmented care model.

## Quality-Driven Investment: $6.9M Supporting Measurable Outcomes

The proposed **$6.9M annual investment** (a **191% increase** from the current $2.4M contract) enables TPCCC to deliver against **6 critical quality metrics**, each weighted at **10%** of performance-based compensation:

| **Quality Metric** | **Target Performance** | **Clinical Impact** |
|-------------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Excess Days (O:E Ratio)** | <1.513 | Reduced length of stay through efficient care |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 | Infection prevention in central line management |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 | Infection prevention in urinary catheter use |
| **Mortality (O:E Ratio)** | <1.61 | Risk-adjusted survival outcomes |
| **Prolonged Ventilation (O:E Ratio)** | <1.0 | Efficient ventilator weaning protocols |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | Care quality and discharge planning |

These metrics create **direct financial accountability** while supporting HFW's broader quality improvement initiatives and regulatory compliance requirements.

## Formalizing Previously Uncompensated Value-Added Services

Beyond baseline critical care coverage, this agreement formalizes compensation for specialized programs that TPCCC currently provides **without subsidy**:

- **ECMO Program Support:** Critical for CVICU cardiogenic shock and high-risk CT surgery patients
- **Interventional Pulmonary Procedures:** Advanced diagnostic and therapeutic bronchoscopy
- **Lung Nodule Program:** Multidisciplinary coordination for early lung cancer detection
- **Enhanced Code Blue Coverage:** Dedicated daytime physician eliminating CVICU APP distraction
- **Graduate Medical Education:** Teaching and supervision for resident and fellow rotations
- **PERT Team Participation:** Pulmonary embolism response coordination

These programs represent **substantial institutional value** that would require significant investment and time for alternative providers to replicate, leveraging TPCCC's **47-year partnership** with Texas Health Fort Worth since 1977.

## Strategic Alignment with Cardiac Program Growth

This proposal directly enables HFW's strategic expansion in cardiac services. The Cardiothoracic Surgery department has specifically requested **expanded intensivist presence** to support growing volumes of high-acuity procedures and post-operative care requirements. The enhanced CVICU staffing model provides the clinical infrastructure necessary for:

- **Cardiogenic shock program expansion** with advanced mechanical circulatory support
- **High-risk cardiothoracic surgery growth** requiring specialized post-operative management  
- **ECMO capability maintenance** for both cardiac and pulmonary indications
- **Impella device management** in complex interventional cardiology cases

The **Cardiac PCU closure** creates a true intermediate care environment with intensivist oversight, enabling appropriate patient placement between the CVICU and general medical-surgical units—improving throughput and resource utilization.

## Implementation: March 2026 with Zero Transition Risk

Target implementation of **March 2026** presents **no operational risk** because TPCCC providers are already deployed in these roles. This is fundamentally a **financial and contractual formalization** rather than a clinical transition—converting existing unsubsidized positions to subsidized status with immediate activation upon contract execution.

The **47-year institutional partnership** eliminates concerns about provider integration, credentialing delays, or care model disruption that would accompany a change to alternative critical care groups. HFW gains immediate access to formalized, quality-metric-driven coverage without the 6-12 month transition period typically required for new provider relationships.

---

**This proposal represents a strategic investment in clinical excellence, quality outcomes, and sustainable partnership**—formalizing the critical care infrastructure that HFW requires to support its cardiac service line growth while ensuring TPCCC's financial viability in delivering specialized, high-acuity care.

# Key Benefits

# Expanded Section: Key Benefits to HFW

## Financial Impact Through Quality Metric Achievement

The proposed coverage model directly enables HFW to achieve **six weighted quality metrics** (each representing **10% of total performance**), generating substantial cost avoidance through evidence-based closed ICU protocols and 24/7 intensivist availability:

| Quality Metric | Target Performance | Cost Avoidance per Prevention | Annual Impact Potential |
|----------------|-------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Excess Days O:E** | <1.513 | $2,000-3,000 per prevented day | High-volume savings across all ICU admissions |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 | $10,000-50,000 per infection | Significant reduction in hospital-acquired complications |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 | $10,000-50,000 per infection | Enhanced infection prevention protocols |
| **Mortality O:E** | <1.61 | Reputational + Star Rating protection | Value-based payment optimization |
| **Prolonged Ventilation O:E** | <1.0 | $2,000-3,000 per prevented excess day | Reduced ICU length of stay |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | $15,000-25,000 per prevention | Improved care transitions and throughput |

**Direct Cost Avoidance Examples:**
- Preventing just **10 excess ICU days monthly** saves **$240,000-360,000 annually**
- Avoiding **5 hospital-acquired infections** prevents **$50,000-250,000** in treatment costs and CMS penalties
- Reducing **8 preventable readmissions** saves **$120,000-200,000** while improving patient experience scores

These metrics directly impact **CMS Star Ratings**, **value-based payment programs**, and **reputational standing**—protecting revenue streams beyond direct cost avoidance.

---

## Strategic Cardiac Program Enablement

The **21-bed CVICU** requires enhanced intensivist presence to support HFW's high-margin cardiac service line expansion. The proposed staffing model (2 daytime physicians + 2 APPs in CVICU alone) directly enables:

**High-Acuity Programs Requiring Intensivist Support:**
- **ECMO program** (already operational through TPCCC, would require significant investment to replicate with alternative providers)
- **Cardiogenic shock management** (vasopressor-dependent patients requiring minute-to-minute titration)
- **Impella mechanical support devices** (high-risk interventional procedures)
- **High-risk cardiothoracic surgeries** (complex post-operative management)

**Cardiothoracic Surgery Department Request:** The CT Surgery team specifically requested expanded intensivist presence to support their growing program volume and complexity. Without dedicated CVICU coverage, these high-revenue service lines face:
- Increased complication rates affecting surgical outcomes
- Limited capacity to accept high-acuity referrals
- Competitive disadvantage versus facilities with robust critical care support
- Surgeon dissatisfaction and potential recruitment/retention challenges

**Closed Cardiac PCU (C1) Model:** The **25-bed Cardiac Intermediate Care unit** currently operates with fragmented coverage (internal medicine physicians + consulting intensivists). Formalizing a dedicated intensivist leadership model:
- Eliminates care gaps for vasopressor-dependent patients in intermediate care settings
- Improves response times for clinical deterioration
- Enhances throughput from CVICU to step-down units
- Standardizes protocols across the cardiac care continuum

This infrastructure supports **strategic growth initiatives** while protecting existing cardiac program revenue.

---

## Compensation for Currently Unsubsidized Value-Added Services

TPCCC currently provides substantial services **without compensation** under the existing $2.4M contract, while deploying **5 physicians and 2 APPs** (subsidized for only 2 physicians). The proposed contract formalizes payment for:

**Specialty Programs Already Operational:**
- **Interventional Pulmonary procedures** (bronchoscopy, EBUS, pleural interventions)
- **Lung Nodule Program** (multidisciplinary coordination and follow-up)
- **Enhanced Code Blue response** (dedicated physician team vs. distracted CVICU coverage)
- **ACGME-compliant GME education** (resident and fellow teaching responsibilities)

**Current Financial Reality:**
- TPCCC operates at approximately **$350K loss per unsubsidized physician** at HFW
- Existing arrangement is financially unsustainable despite **48-year partnership** (since 1977)
- Alternative providers would require significant investment and time to replicate these established programs

**Competitive Advantage:** These programs represent **deep institutional knowledge** and operational infrastructure that cannot be easily transferred. Formalizing compensation protects HFW's investment in these capabilities while ensuring TPCCC's continued financial viability.

---

## Dedicated Staffing Model Eliminating Operational Inefficiencies

The current informal coverage model creates **distraction-based inefficiencies** that compromise both ICU care and hospital-wide response capabilities. The proposed structure eliminates these conflicts through role separation:

**Dedicated Coverage Teams:**

| Role | Current Model (Problem) | Proposed Model (Solution) |
|------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Code Blue Response** | CVICU APP pulled from bedside care | Dedicated Day Call physician + APP (M-F) |
| **Pulmonary Consults** | Ad-hoc coverage by ICU physicians | Dedicated Pulmonary On-Call physician + APP (7 days/week) |
| **Cardiac PCU** | Fragmented internal medicine + consults | Closed unit with dedicated intensivist (M-F) |
| **CVICU Coverage** | Single physician managing 21 patients | 2 physicians + 2 APPs (safe ratios per SCCM guidelines) |

**Operational Benefits:**
- **Improved response times:** Code Blue team immediately available without competing priorities
- **Enhanced throughput:** Dedicated Cardiac PCU leadership reduces bottlenecks in CVICU-to-floor transitions
- **Reduced complications:** Appropriate physician-to-patient ratios (1:7 to 1:14) and APP-to-patient ratios (1:4 to 1:8) per Society of Critical Care Medicine standards
- **Decreased transfer rates:** 24/7 intensivist availability reduces need for higher-level care transfers

**Evidence Base:** This model aligns with **American Heart Association guidelines** for high-intensity, closed ICU models, which demonstrate lower ICU mortality, improved adherence to evidence-based practices, and enhanced team satisfaction.

---

## Revenue Protection Through Multi-Dimensional Quality Performance

Beyond direct cost avoidance, the proposed coverage model protects **revenue streams** through three interconnected mechanisms:

**1. CMS Star Rating Improvement:**
- Mortality O:E <1.61 achievement directly impacts overall hospital ratings
- Quality metric performance affects patient choice and referral patterns
- Star Rating influences Medicare Advantage plan inclusion and reimbursement rates

**2. Value-Based Payment Optimization:**
- All six quality metrics tie to value-based purchasing programs
- Performance-based incentive payments included in contract structure
- Shared accountability model aligns TPCCC and HFW financial interests

**3. Reputational Enhancement:**
- Public reporting of quality metrics affects market positioning
- Surgeon satisfaction with critical care support influences recruitment and retention
- Reduced complications and readmissions improve patient experience scores

**Competitive Market Context:** HFW operates in a competitive healthcare market where quality differentiation drives patient volume. Achieving target performance across all six metrics positions HFW as a **high-quality cardiac care destination** while protecting against value-based payment penalties.

---

## Operational Efficiency Gains From 24/7 Intensivist Availability

The transition from current informal coverage to a **formalized 24/7 intensivist model** generates operational efficiencies that extend beyond direct quality metrics:

**Clinical Efficiency Improvements:**
- **Reduced length of stay:** Evidence-based closed unit protocols standardize care delivery and reduce practice variation
- **Decreased complication rates:** Immediate intensivist availability for clinical deterioration prevents escalation
- **Improved care transitions:** Dedicated Cardiac PCU leadership coordinates CVICU-to-floor handoffs
- **Enhanced protocol adherence:** Consistent intensivist presence ensures compliance with evidence-based bundles (VAP prevention, CLABSI/CAUTI protocols, early mobility)

**System-Level Benefits:**
- **Reduced transfer rates:** Appropriate on-site critical care capability decreases need for tertiary center transfers
- **Improved ED throughput:** Reliable ICU acceptance and management reduces ED boarding
- **Enhanced surgical scheduling:** Predictable post-operative ICU availability supports OR efficiency
- **Better resource utilization:** Proactive intensivist management optimizes ventilator days, ICU bed-days, and ancillary service utilization

**Partnership Continuity:** The **47-year relationship** between TPCCC and HFW (since 1977) provides institutional knowledge and cultural integration that alternative providers cannot replicate. This continuity minimizes transition risks and preserves operational workflows.

**Implementation Advantage:** Because TPCCC providers are **already deployed** in these roles, the March 2026 implementation represents **zero transition risk or coverage gaps**—this is purely a financial and contractual formalization of existing high-performing operations.

These services expand HFW's pulmonary capabilities without requiring separate specialty contracts.

**Lung Nodule Program Development:** Our team has established a comprehensive lung nodule evaluation and management program, providing coordinated care for patients with indeterminate pulmonary findings. This program enhances early lung cancer detection and improves patient outcomes through systematic follow-up protocols.

These specialty programs would require **significant investment and 12-24 months** for alternative providers to replicate, creating substantial transition risk and potential service gaps if HFW were to change critical care partners.

---

## Deliberate APP Training & Development Program

TPCCC maintains a structured Advanced Practice Provider (APP) training and development program that ensures high-quality critical care extender coverage. Our APPs receive ongoing education in hemodynamic monitoring, mechanical ventilation, vasopressor management, and critical care pharmacology—competencies essential for managing HFW's high-acuity patient population.

**Our APP deployment model meets national standards:**

- **CVICU Coverage:** 2 APPs supporting 21-patient census with ECMO capability (1:4-7 patient ratios)
- **Pulmonary On-Call:** 1 APP providing 7-day coverage for consultation services
- **Code Blue Support:** Dedicated APP eliminating CVICU distraction during rapid response events
- **Cardiac PCU:** APP coverage for 25-bed high-acuity intermediate care unit

This deliberate approach to APP utilization maximizes physician efficiency while maintaining safe patient ratios and quality outcomes. Our APPs function as true critical care extenders—not substitutes for physician oversight—ensuring that complex decision-making remains physician-directed while routine monitoring and procedural tasks are appropriately delegated.

---

## Long-Term Commitment to HFW's Cardiac Mission

TPCCC is recruiting a **dual-trained cardiologist-intensivist** scheduled to join our team in **August 2026**. This strategic addition demonstrates our long-term commitment to HFW's cardiac service line and provides specialized expertise uniquely suited to the CVICU patient population.

Dual-trained intensivists bring combined expertise in:

- Cardiogenic shock and acute heart failure protocols

This recruitment investment—made specifically to enhance HFW's CVICU program—illustrates TPCCC's strategic alignment with the hospital's growth priorities and our confidence in the long-term partnership. Alternative providers would lack this specialized cardiovascular critical care expertise and would require additional time and resources to recruit comparable talent.

---

## GME Integration Expertise & Educational Value

TPCCC provides **ACGME-compliant Internal Medicine resident education** as an integral component of our HFW partnership. Our physicians serve as teaching faculty, supervising residents during ICU rotations and providing structured didactic education in critical care medicine.

**This GME integration delivers value beyond clinical coverage:**

- Enhances HFW's academic reputation and resident recruitment
- Provides cost-effective clinical coverage through resident participation
- Ensures evidence-based practice through academic medicine culture
- Supports HFW's teaching hospital mission and community education role
- Creates physician pipeline for future recruitment opportunities

Our teaching expertise and ACGME compliance would be difficult for alternative providers to replicate, particularly groups without established academic medicine experience or existing residency program affiliations.

---

## Operational Readiness & Zero Transition Risk

The proposed contract expansion represents a **formalization of existing operations**—not a new service launch requiring ramp-up time. TPCCC already deploys **5 physicians and 2 APPs** during daytime operations at HFW, meaning the infrastructure, workflows, and team relationships are fully established.

**This operational readiness provides critical advantages:**

- **Immediate implementation capability** with March 2026 target start date
- **Zero coverage gaps** during transition (providers already credentialed and active)
- **No workflow disruption** to nursing staff, surgeons, or hospital operations
- **Established quality metrics tracking** with proven performance history
- **Existing EMR integration** and documentation standards

Alternative providers would require 6-12 months minimum to achieve the operational proficiency TPCCC has developed over 48 years of partnership. This transition period would create quality risks, staff dissatisfaction, and potential disruption to HFW's strategic cardiac programs during a critical growth phase.

---

**TPCCC's combination of legacy partnership, comprehensive service scope, evidence-based staffing models, specialty program leadership, and operational readiness creates a unique value proposition that cannot be replicated by alternative critical care providers in the North Texas market.**

## Phase 2: Operational Optimization & Protocol Establishment
**Timeline: Months 2-3 (April-May 2026)**

With the staffing model activated, Phase 2 focuses on optimizing workflows, eliminating operational inefficiencies, and establishing the infrastructure for quality metric tracking. This phase transforms the formalized coverage model into a high-performance system aligned with Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines for closed ICU operations.

### Code Blue/Day Call Team Protocol Development

The dedicated Code Blue/Day Call team (1 physician + 1 APP on weekdays) requires standardized protocols to eliminate the previous model where CVICU APPs were pulled from bedside care to respond to hospital-wide emergencies. Protocol development includes:

- **Rapid Response Activation Criteria:** Clear triggers for team deployment
- **Code Blue Response Algorithms:** Standardized approach for cardiac arrest management
- **Escalation Pathways:** Defined handoff procedures to ICU teams for post-resuscitation care
- **Communication Standards:** Real-time updates to primary teams and families

**Impact:** CVICU APPs remain focused on their **21-patient census** with ECMO, Impella, and cardiogenic shock patients—eliminating dangerous distractions during high-acuity procedures.

### Quality Metric Tracking Dashboard Implementation

A comprehensive dashboard system launches to monitor **6 weighted performance indicators** (each representing 10% of total quality score). This real-time tracking enables proactive intervention when metrics trend unfavorably:

| Quality Metric | Target (O:E Ratio or %) | Tracking Frequency | Dashboard Display |
|----------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Excess Days** | O:E <1.513 | Daily census review | Trend line with 30-day rolling average |
| **CLABSI** | O:E <0.589 | Per infection occurrence | Cumulative rate vs. target threshold |
| **CAUTI** | O:E <0.538 | Per infection occurrence | Cumulative rate vs. target threshold |
| **Mortality** | O:E <1.61 | Daily mortality review | Risk-adjusted trend with peer comparison |
| **Prolonged Ventilation** | O:E <1.0 | Per patient >96 hours | Ventilator day tracking with weaning protocol adherence |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | Per readmission event | Percentage calculation with root cause flags |

Dashboard access extends to HFW leadership, enabling transparent performance monitoring and collaborative problem-solving when improvement opportunities emerge.

### Nighttime Cross-Coverage Algorithm Finalization

Nighttime staffing protocols ensure seamless 24/7 coverage across all units with appropriate physician-to-patient and APP-to-patient ratios aligned with national safety standards:

**Weekday Nights (Monday-Thursday):**
- **2 Physicians:** Cross-covering MICU, CVICU, and Cardiac PCU with defined escalation pathways
- **3 APPs:** Dedicated bedside coverage maintaining safe ratios (1:4 to 1:8 per SCCM guidelines)

**Weekend Nights (Friday-Sunday):**
- **1 Physician:** Senior coverage with backup call system
- **3 APPs:** Maintained bedside presence ensuring continuity

Cross-coverage algorithms define:
- Unit prioritization during simultaneous emergencies
- Backup call activation criteria
- Handoff procedures between day and night teams
- Communication protocols with Cardiothoracic Surgery for post-operative patients

### Phase 2 Deliverables

- **Code Blue/Day Call Protocols:** Documented response algorithms and escalation pathways
- **Quality Dashboard:** Live tracking system with automated alerts for metric deviations
- **Nighttime Coverage Algorithms:** Formalized cross-coverage protocols with defined responsibilities
- **Staff Training:** Orientation for all providers on new protocols and dashboard utilization

## Phase 3: Quality Performance Baseline & Program Enhancement
**Timeline: Months 4-6 (June-August 2026)**

Phase 3 establishes the performance baseline using current metrics to track improvement trajectories toward targets. This period provides the data foundation for the **February 2027 annual performance review** and incentive payment reconciliation. A significant program enhancement occurs mid-phase with the integration of a dual-trained specialist.

### Quality Metric Baseline Establishment

Using **current metrics as the starting point**, TPCCC and HFW collaboratively establish baseline performance across all 6 indicators. This baseline serves multiple purposes:

1. **Improvement Trajectory Mapping:** Quantifies progress from baseline to target over the contract year
2. **Incentive Payment Calculation:** Provides the reference point for performance-based compensation
3. **Resource Allocation:** Identifies units or metrics requiring focused intervention
4. **Competitive Benchmarking:** Compares HFW performance to regional and national peers

**Baseline Documentation Process:**

| Month | Activity | Outcome |
|-------|----------|---------|
| **Month 4** | Historical data compilation (prior 12 months) | Baseline O:E ratios and percentages established |
| **Month 5** | Trend analysis and peer comparison | Gap identification between baseline and targets |
| **Month 6** | Improvement initiative prioritization | Action plans for underperforming metrics |

Each metric receives individual attention with root cause analysis for baseline performance. For example:
- **Excess Days:** Analysis of discharge barriers, care coordination gaps, and social determinant factors
- **CLABSI/CAUTI:** Review of insertion practices, maintenance bundles, and removal protocols
- **Mortality:** Risk stratification review and end-of-life care pathway assessment
- **Prolonged Ventilation:** Weaning protocol adherence and sedation practice evaluation
- **Readmissions:** Post-discharge follow-up processes and care transition quality

### August 2026: Dual-Trained Cardiologist-Intensivist Integration

A significant program enhancement occurs in **August 2026** with the addition of a dual-trained cardiologist-intensivist to the CVICU model. This specialized provider brings unique value to HFW's strategic cardiac programs:

**Clinical Expertise:**
- Board certification in both Critical Care Medicine and Cardiology

# Terms of Agreement

# Terms of Agreement

This agreement formalizes the existing critical care deployment at Texas Health Harris Fort Worth while establishing a sustainable financial framework that reflects the actual scope of services currently provided. The contract addresses the significant gap between TPCCC's current **$2.4M subsidy** (covering only 2 physicians) and the reality of **5 physicians and 5 APPs** already deployed across HFW's critical care units.

## Contract Value and Structure

**Total Annual Contract Value:** **$6,987,240**

This represents a **$4.5M incremental investment** beyond the current contract, formalizing compensation for services TPCCC already provides but which remain unsubsidized under the existing agreement. The current arrangement creates an unsustainable financial burden, with TPCCC absorbing significant losses to maintain critical care coverage that HFW's expanding cardiac programs require.

| Current State | Proposed Agreement | Net Change |
|---------------|-------------------|------------|
| **$2.4M** annual subsidy | **$6,987,240** annual subsidy | **$4,587,240** increase |
| 2 subsidized physicians | 5 subsidized physicians | +3 physicians formalized |
| 2 subsidized APPs | 5 subsidized APPs | +3 APPs formalized |
| Informal coverage model | Contractually guaranteed service | Risk mitigation |

**Financial Context:** The proposed contract eliminates the current practice of providing uncompensated critical care services, including ECMO program support, Interventional Pulmonary procedures, Lung Nodule Program operations, and enhanced Code Blue response—all of which HFW's strategic cardiac initiatives depend upon but which generate substantial losses for TPCCC under the existing arrangement.

## Contract Term and Renewal Provisions

**Initial Term:** **1 year** commencing **March 2026**

**Renewal Structure:**
- Annual inflation adjustments applied to base compensation
- Automatic renewal provisions subject to performance metric achievement
- Quarterly review process with contract adjustment mechanisms
- Either party may provide written notice of non-renewal **90 days** prior to term expiration

The one-year term provides both organizations flexibility to assess the formalized coverage model's effectiveness while maintaining stability for the critical care programs that depend on consistent intensivist presence.

## Performance-Based Incentive Structure

Contract compensation includes performance-based incentive payments tied to achievement of **6 quality metrics**, each weighted at **10%** of the incentive pool. This structure aligns TPCCC's financial outcomes directly with HFW's quality improvement objectives and ensures accountability for measurable patient care outcomes.

| Quality Metric | Target Performance | Weight | Current Baseline |
|----------------|-------------------|--------|------------------|
| **Excess Days O:E Ratio** | <1.513 | 10% | Requires improvement |
| **CLABSI Rate** | <0.589 | 10% | Requires improvement |
| **CAUTI Rate** | <0.538 | 10% | Requires improvement |
| **Mortality O:E Ratio** | <1.61 | 10% | Requires improvement |
| **Prolonged Ventilation O:E** | <1.0 | 10% | Requires improvement |
| **24-Hour Readmissions** | <3% | 10% | Requires improvement |

**Incentive Payment Mechanism:**
- Quarterly measurement periods with annual reconciliation
- Pro-rated payments based on percentage of metrics achieved
- Maximum incentive payment represents **[percentage TBD]** of base contract value
- Metrics measured using HFW's existing quality reporting infrastructure

This performance framework ensures the expanded investment delivers measurable returns through improved patient outcomes, reduced complications, and enhanced care efficiency—directly supporting HFW's quality objectives and competitive positioning.

## Scope of Services Included

The agreement formalizes comprehensive critical care coverage across HFW's highest-acuity units, guaranteeing continued service delivery for programs currently operating under informal arrangements. This contractual guarantee eliminates coverage uncertainty and ensures HFW's strategic cardiac initiatives have the intensivist support required for sustainable growth.

**Critical Care Unit Coverage:**

| Unit | Bed Capacity | Staffing Model | Coverage Hours |
|------|--------------|----------------|----------------|
| **MICU** | 22 patients | 1 physician (7 days/week) | 24/7 |
| **CVICU** | 21 beds (high-acuity) | 1 physician + 2 APPs (7 days/week) | 24/7 |
| **Cardiac PCU (C1)** | 25 beds (closed unit) | 1 physician (M-F) | Weekday daytime |
| **Code Blue/Day Call** | Hospital-wide | 1 physician (M-F) | Weekday daytime |
| **Pulmonary On-Call** | Consult service | 1 physician + 1 APP (7 days/week) | 24/7 |

**Specialized Program Support:**
- **ECMO Program:** Clinical oversight and management for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation patients in CVICU
- **Interventional Pulmonary Services:** Bronchoscopy, endobronchial ultrasound, pleural procedures
- **Lung Nodule Program:** Multidisciplinary coordination and procedural support
- **GME Education:** Teaching responsibilities for resident and fellow rotations through critical care units

**Clinical Service Guarantees:**
- 24/7 intensivist availability for MICU and CVICU
- Dedicated Code Blue response team eliminating CVICU APP distraction
- Closed Cardiac PCU model providing direct intensivist leadership for vasopressor-dependent patients
- Pulmonary consultation services supporting hospital-wide respiratory care needs

This scope effectively formalizes current practice patterns while providing contractual guarantees that protect HFW's ability to maintain high-acuity cardiac programs, ECMO capabilities, and specialized pulmonary services that differentiate the facility within the Texas Health Resources system.

## Scope of Services Excluded

**Geographic Limitations:**
- Services apply exclusively to Texas Health Harris Fort Worth
- Other Texas Health Resources facilities require separate contractual agreements
- No coverage obligations for THR system-wide initiatives outside HFW campus

**Service Boundaries:**
- Critical care services beyond the defined units (MICU, CVICU, Cardiac PCU) require separate agreements
- Expansion to additional units or facilities triggers contract amendment and pricing adjustment processes
- Specialty services outside critical care and pulmonary medicine fall outside scope

These exclusions ensure clear boundaries around TPCCC's service obligations and prevent scope creep that could undermine the financial sustainability of the formalized coverage model.

## Quarterly Volume and Acuity Review Process

The agreement includes structured review mechanisms ensuring contract terms remain aligned with actual patient census, acuity levels, and service utilization throughout the term. This protects both organizations from misalignment between contracted coverage and real-world operational demands.

**Review Components:**
- **Quarterly census analysis** comparing actual patient volumes against contracted assumptions
- **Acuity trending** using severity-adjusted metrics to identify shifts in patient complexity
- **Staffing ratio assessment** evaluating whether physician-to-patient and APP-to-patient ratios remain within safe, evidence-based ranges
- **Service utilization patterns** tracking Code Blue responses, pulmonary consultations, and procedural volumes

**Contract Adjustment Mechanisms:**
- **Minimum census guarantees:** If sustained census falls below contracted levels, proportional subsidy adjustments apply
- **Surge protocol provisions:** Temporary census increases beyond contracted capacity trigger supplemental compensation
- **Acuity escalation clauses:** Sustained increases in patient complexity may warrant staffing model adjustments and corresponding contract amendments

**Process Timeline:**
- Quarterly data review meetings between TPCCC leadership and HFW administration
- 30-day window for either party to request contract modifications based on review findings
- Mutual agreement required for mid-term adjustments; disputes escalate to executive leadership

This structured review process ensures the contract remains financially sustainable for TPCCC while guaranteeing HFW receives coverage appropriate to actual patient care demands—preventing the current situation where informal arrangements create financial losses and coverage uncertainty.

## Implementation Timeline and Approval Process

**Target Implementation Date:** **March 2026**

The implementation timeline requires coordination across multiple approval stages and operational preparation activities. Because TPCCC providers are already deployed in the proposed coverage model, implementation focuses on contractual formalization and financial activation rather than clinical transition—eliminating coverage gaps and transition risks.

**Critical Path Milestones:**

| Milestone | Target Date | Key Activities | Responsible Party |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|
| **CFO Financial Review** | January 2026 | Budget impact analysis, ROI modeling, competitive comparison | HFW Finance + TPCCC |
| **Board Approval** | February 2026 | Executive presentation, board materials, approval vote | HFW Board of Directors |
| **Credentialing Updates** | February 2026 | Privilege adjustments, unit assignment changes, documentation | HFW Medical Staff Office |
| **Contract Execution** | March 2026 | Final signatures, subsidy activation, billing system updates | Both parties |
| **Go-Live** | March 2026 | Financial conversion, no clinical changes required | TPCCC + HFW Finance |

**Implementation Advantages:**
- **Zero transition risk:** Providers already in place and operationally integrated
- **No coverage gaps:** Current staffing model mirrors proposed contract structure
- **Immediate quality metric tracking:** Baseline data already established for performance incentives
- **No clinical disruption:** Implementation is purely financial and contractual, not operational

**Phased Implementation Option:**

If timeline constraints emerge during the CFO review or Board approval process, a phased implementation approach remains available:

- **Phase 1 (March 2026):** Formalize MICU and CVICU coverage with partial subsidy increase
- **Phase 2 (July 2026):** Add Cardiac PCU and Code Blue/Day Call subsidization
- **Phase 3 (October 2026):** Complete transition to full contract value with all services subsidized

However, the phased approach extends the period during which TPCCC operates at financial loss and delays HFW's contractual guarantee of continued critical care services. Given that providers are already deployed, immediate full implementation represents the lower-risk path for both organizations.

**Parallel Credentialing Process:**

While contract negotiations proceed, HFW Medical Staff Office will update:
- Unit assignments formalizing Cardiac PCU privileges
- Call schedules reflecting dedicated Code Blue/Day Call roles
- Privilege delineations for Interventional Pulmonary procedures
- GME teaching appointments for education responsibilities

This parallel processing ensures all operational elements align with contract execution, enabling seamless activation on the March 2026 go-live date.

**Project Title:** *The project 'HFW Renegotiation' is set to address the critical need to renegotiate the existing contract between TPCCC and HFW. This initiative is a strategic response to the growing need for adjustments in the staffing model, particularly within the Cardiac ICU department. The project will focus on fostering a mutually beneficial agreement for both TPCCC and HFW, considering the financial impact and strategic importance of the renegotiation.*  
**Project Sponsor:** The project sponsor, John Hollingsworth, will play a crucial role in providing strategic direction and decision-making authority for the 'HFW Renegotiation' project. As the project sponsor, Mr. Hollingsworth will also facilitate the necessary resources, support the project manager in overcoming challenges, and assist in aligning the project objectives with the broader organizational goals.  
**Department:** The TPCCC department, as the primary stakeholder, will actively engage in the renegotiation process. Their engagement will be critical in ensuring the new contract aligns with their operational requirements, particularly concerning staffing needs and their role in providing critical care to patients within the HFW facility.  
**Date:** December 2025

## 1. Project Goal

**Desired Outcome:**  
The primary goal of the 'HFW Renegotiation' project is to establish a new contract with HFW that aligns with TPCCC's current practice and operational dynamics. The renegotiated contract aims to address the current situation where many unsubsidized providers operate in the hospital, providing substantial benefits to HFW at significant cost to TPCCC. These benefits include Interventional Pulmonary/Lung Nodule Support and other initiatives rendered free of charge.

**Success Measures:**
The success of the 'HFW Renegotiation' project will be determined by the successful renegotiation and implementation of a new contract. This new contract should address the issues identified in the existing contract, particularly those related to staffing and subsidy provisions. The finalized contract should meet TPCCC's operational requirements and ensure a sustainable and mutually beneficial agreement with HFW.

## 2. Business Need & Opportunity

**Business Need:**  
The renegotiation of the contract is driven by three primary business needs. Firstly, to reduce the firm's specific risk associated with the current contract terms. Secondly, to improve the operating profitability through better financial terms and conditions. Lastly, to sustainably grow revenues by aligning the contract to TPCCC's operational needs and strategic objectives.

**Desired Outcomes:**  
The desired outcome of this project is a new contract with a targeted value of approximately 6.9 million dollars in the final proposal. Successful achievement of this outcome will signify the realization of strategic goals, including improved operating profitability, reduced firm-specific risk, and sustained revenue growth.

## 3. Problem / Opportunity Definition

The problem at hand is the current contract with the hospital, which requires TPCCC to manage the PCU patients. In addition, there are requests from other services, particularly Cardiothoracic Surgery, for an expanded intensivist presence in the cardiac ICU. To accommodate these changes, an increase in the current contract value is needed, which necessitates a comprehensive contract renegotiation.

---

## 4. Proposed Solution

The proposed solution to the problem is to transition to the new coverage model detailed in the project notes. This model involves an increase in the number of daytime physicians, specific requirements for staffing in the cardiac ICU, and adjustments in subsidy provisions. The adoption of this model will be factored into the renegotiated contract to ensure the cost-effectiveness and strategic alignment of the new agreement.

---

## 5. Alignment with Strategic Goals

The 'HFW Renegotiation' project aligns with TPCCC's organizational goals, particularly the delivery of high-quality care. The renegotiated contract will have direct implications on staffing and resource allocation, which are vital components of care delivery. Therefore, successful completion of this project will contribute to TPCCC's commitment to patient care excellence.

---

## 6. Selection Criteria


The selection criteria for the renegotiated contract will be its cost-effectiveness and strategic importance. Cost-effectiveness will be evaluated by the financial feasibility and projected profitability of the new terms. The strategic importance will be assessed by the alignment of the new contract with TPCCC's operational requirements and strategic goals.

## 7. Cost / Benefit Analysis

### **Measurable Benefits**

One of the measurable benefits of this project will be the ability to track productivity on a per shift basis. This enhanced visibility into operations can lead to improved resource allocation, better staffing decisions, and ultimately, an increase in operating profitability.



### **Detailed Analysis**

A comprehensive cost-benefit analysis will be conducted during the planning phase of the project. This analysis will compare the financial impact of the current contract with the anticipated benefits of the renegotiated contract. The findings will inform the renegotiation process and help ensure the cost-effectiveness of the new agreement.

---

## 8. Scope

The scope of the 'HFW Renegotiation' project is confined to the renegotiation of the contract with HFW. It does not extend to any other contracts TPCCC has with other THR facilities or other entities. All activities, deliverables, and outcomes will be focused solely on the HFW contract renegotiation.

---

## 9. Major Deliverables

The key deliverables of this project include comprehensive financial projections and a proposal for the new contract. The financial projections will outline the anticipated costs and revenues associated with the proposed changes in staffing and resource allocation. The proposal will encapsulate the terms and conditions of the new contract, reflecting the agreed-upon changes.

---

## 10. Risks & Mitigation

One of the primary risks associated with this project is overextending and not being profitable on the contract. This risk can arise from the proposed changes in staffing and subsidy provisions, and if not properly managed, could impact TPCCC's financial stability and operational performance.

**Initial Assumptions:**  
An initial assumption in this project is that the renegotiated contract can be closed around the target value of 6.9 million dollars. This assumption is based on preliminary analysis and is subject to change as the renegotiation process progresses and more accurate data becomes available.

## 11. Schedule Overview

This project requires a quick turnaround of the proposal to facilitate early reviews, as the negotiations are scheduled to happen in March of the following year. This tight schedule necessitates efficient project management, proactive stakeholder engagement, and timely decision-making.



---

## 12. High-Level Requirements

One of the high-level requirements for this project is access to historical data. This data, including past financials, staffing patterns, and service demands, will be instrumental in informing the financial projections and the terms of the renegotiated contract.

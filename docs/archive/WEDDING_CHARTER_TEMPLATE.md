## 8. Risks & Assumptions

```
RISKS:
- Budget overruns: Vendors charge more than quoted, unexpected costs arise
  Mitigation: Lock in prices in contracts, build [X]% contingency buffer
  
- Vendor cancellation: Key vendor unavailable on wedding date
  Mitigation: Backup vendors identified, penalty clauses in contracts, insurance considered
  
- Guest logistics: Late RSVPs, last-minute cancellations, parking/accommodation issues
  Mitigation: RSVP deadline enforced, waitlist managed, clear logistics guide sent
  
- Weather disruption: Rain/extreme weather impacts outdoor plans
  Mitigation: Tent rental, indoor backup location, contingency schedule
  
- Schedule slippage: Ceremony/reception runs behind, timeline compresses
  Mitigation: Buffer time built in, clear vendor communication, day-of coordinator empowered to decide
  
- Scope creep: Additional guests, additional events, expanded vision mid-planning
  Mitigation: Guest list frozen at [DATE], decisions documented, change request process defined

ASSUMPTIONS:
- [PARTNER NAME] and I are aligned on wedding vision and budget
- Key family members will assist with planning (list roles: [NAME] = invitations, [NAME] = decorations)
- Venue and [X] key vendors available on [DATE]
- Guest list stabilizes by [DATE - 12 weeks]
- Weather will be [SEASON-APPROPRIATE or HAVE BACKUP PLAN]
- We will have final headcount by [DATE - 6 weeks]
- Post-wedding storage/cleanup handled by [WHO/WHEN]
- Budget: $[X] total, with [X]% contingency

## How to Use This Template

1. **Copy each section** (1-8 above) into your project_charter_lite form
2. **Replace bracketed placeholders** with your specific details
3. **Answer the clarification questions** that appear
4. **Generate the charter** and review the outline
5. **Refine and iterate** as needed

---

## Tips for Filling In

- **Be specific**: "June 15, 2026 at Riverside Estate" beats "summer wedding"
- **Define success early**: "75 guests" and "within $X budget" are measurable
- **Name people**: "Mom will handle floral design" vs "someone will handle flowers"
- **Lock scope**: Clear "in/out" prevents scope creep mid-planning
- **Budget buffer**: Add 10-15% contingency for unexpected costs
- **Contingency plans**: For outdoor weddings, always have indoor backup
- **Timeline dates**: Work backward from wedding date (6 months = venue + saves, 3 months = invites, etc.)

---

## Customization Ideas

**For destination weddings:**
- Add travel coordination, visa requirements, multi-time-zone logistics

**For small intimate weddings (< 30 people):**
- Simplify vendor list, less formal timeline, more flexible schedule

**For large formal weddings (> 150 people):**
- Add more vendor roles (day-of coordinator, planner, valet, lighting)
- Build longer timeline (8-12 months recommended)
- Add seating chart complexity and logistics

**For budget-conscious weddings:**
- Emphasize DIY elements, vendor negotiation, phased spending
- Add cost-tracking requirement to success criteria

Good luck! 🎉

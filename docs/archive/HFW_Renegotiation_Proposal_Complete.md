# Cover Letter

We are pleased to submit this comprehensive proposal to formalize and expand our critical care partnership with Texas Health Resources Fort Worth. Since 1977, Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants has maintained an uninterrupted 48-year relationship with your institution, developing deep institutional knowledge of HFW's operations, culture, and strategic priorities. This enduring partnership has positioned TPCCC as uniquely qualified to support your organization's current growth trajectory and quality improvement initiatives.

HFW's strategic expansion of cardiac programs—including cardiogenic shock management, ECMO capabilities, Impella support, and high-risk cardiothoracic surgery—represents a significant institutional commitment to advanced cardiovascular care. These programs demand enhanced intensivist coverage to ensure optimal patient outcomes and sustainable program growth. The Cardiothoracic Surgery department has specifically requested expanded intensivist presence in the 21-bed CVICU to support these high-acuity initiatives. Simultaneously, your organization has identified the need to formalize leadership for the 25-bed Cardiac Progressive Care Unit (C1), where vasopressor-dependent patients currently receive fragmented care. This proposal directly addresses these critical coverage gaps while supporting your broader strategic vision for cardiovascular excellence.

This proposal formalizes compensation for substantial services TPCCC currently provides without subsidy, including our Interventional Pulmonary program, Lung Nodule Program, enhanced Code Blue coverage, and ECMO program support. Our current contract subsidizes only 2 physicians, yet TPCCC already deploys 5 physicians and 2 APPs during daytime operations—an arrangement that creates significant financial strain while delivering exceptional value to HFW. The proposed $6.9M annual contract converts this informal arrangement into a sustainable, formalized partnership that appropriately compensates for services rendered while ensuring continuity of the specialized programs your clinical teams have come to depend upon.

We recognize that this investment must demonstrate clear return through measurable quality improvements. This proposal includes performance-based accountability aligned with your 6 weighted quality metrics: Excess Days O:E ratio below 1.513, CLABSI rate below 0.589, CAUTI rate below 0.538, Mortality O:E ratio below 1.61, Prolonged Ventilation O:E ratio below 1.0, and 24-hour Readmission rate below 3%—each weighted at 10% of total performance measurement. Our collaborative implementation timeline targets March 2026, allowing adequate time for contract finalization, CFO review, Board approval, and credentialing processes. We are committed to working closely with your leadership team to ensure seamless execution and immediate impact on patient outcomes. This proposal represents not merely a contract expansion, but a strategic partnership investment in HFW's future as a regional leader in advanced cardiovascular care.

# Executive Summary

Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants currently operates at a significant financial loss at Texas Health Fort Worth, deploying 5 physicians and 2 Advanced Practice Providers in daytime operations while receiving subsidy for only 2 physicians under the existing $2.4M contract. This arrangement effectively means TPCCC provides approximately $4.5M in uncompensated critical care services annually, with each unsubsidized physician position averaging $350K in losses. The current informal model has allowed TPCCC to maintain its 47-year partnership with the hospital while delivering specialized services including ECMO program support, Interventional Pulmonary, Lung Nodule programs, and PERT team operations—none of which receive formal compensation. This financially unsustainable structure requires immediate formalization to ensure continued service delivery and support HFW's strategic growth initiatives.

HFW's expansion of advanced cardiac programs—including cardiogenic shock management, ECMO capabilities, Impella support, and high-risk cardiothoracic surgeries—has created urgent staffing requirements that exceed the current contract's scope. The Cardiothoracic Surgery department specifically requests enhanced intensivist presence in the 21-bed CVICU to support increasing patient acuity and complexity. Additionally, the hospital requires formalized closed coverage for the 25-bed Cardiac Progressive Care Unit (C1), where vasopressor-dependent patients currently receive fragmented care from internal medicine hospitalists supplemented by consulting intensivists. This coverage gap creates clinical risk and operational inefficiency that formal intensivist leadership would resolve.

The proposed $6.9M annual contract—a 191% increase from the current agreement—formalizes the existing staffing model while adding critical capabilities aligned to Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines for high-intensity, closed ICU operations. The structure includes 5 subsidized physicians covering MICU (7 days/week), CVICU (7 days/week), Cardiac PCU (weekdays), dedicated Code Blue/Day Call team (weekdays), and Pulmonary On-Call services (7 days/week), supplemented by 5 daytime APPs supporting the CVICU (2 APPs for 21-patient census), Pulmonary consults (1 APP), Code Blue response (1 APP), and Cardiac PCU (1 APP). This evidence-based model maintains safe physician-to-patient ratios of 1:7 to 1:14 and APP-to-patient ratios of 1:4 to 1:8, which research demonstrates reduces ICU and hospital mortality while improving adherence to evidence-based practices.

This investment delivers measurable return through multiple value streams: achievement of 6 quality metrics weighted at 10% each (Excess Days O:E <1.513, CLABSI <0.589, CAUTI <0.538, Mortality O:E <1.61, Prolonged Ventilation O:E <1.0, and 24-hour Readmissions <3%), cost avoidance from reduced hospital-acquired infections and length of stay, revenue protection for high-margin cardiac service lines that depend on intensivist support, and formalized compensation for specialized programs that currently operate without subsidy. The March 2026 implementation timeline requires no phased ramp-up since providers are already deployed, converting this from a clinical transition to a contractual formalization with immediate activation. The performance-based incentive structure ensures shared accountability between TPCCC and HFW for clinical outcomes and strategic program success, aligning financial incentives with the hospital's quality targets and service line growth objectives.

# Key Benefits

This enhanced partnership model directly addresses HFW's strategic imperatives while protecting critical revenue streams and advancing patient care quality. The expanded coverage structure—featuring 5 daytime physicians and 5 APPs during weekdays, supplemented by 2 nighttime physicians and 3 nighttime APPs—enables HFW to pursue aggressive growth in high-margin cardiac programs including cardiogenic shock management, ECMO, Impella support, and high-risk cardiothoracic surgery. The dedicated 21-bed CVICU coverage with 1 physician and 2 APPs provides the specialized intensivist presence specifically requested by the Cardiothoracic Surgery department, removing capacity constraints that currently limit program expansion. Simultaneously, the closed Cardiac PCU model for the 25-bed C1 unit resolves a critical patient safety gap where ICU-level acuity patients requiring vasopressors and chronic ventilators currently receive fragmented care from internal medicine physicians supplemented by consulting intensivists—a model that increases complication risk and delays definitive treatment.

The financial protection embedded in this partnership extends far beyond direct clinical care. Six weighted quality metrics—Excess Days, CLABSI, CAUTI, Mortality, Prolonged Ventilation, and 24-hour Readmissions, each carrying 10% weighting—directly impact HFW's reimbursement and CMS Star Ratings. Meeting the defined targets (Excess Days O:E <1.513, CLABSI <0.589, CAUTI <0.538, Mortality O:E <1.61, Prolonged Ventilation O:E <1.0, Readmissions <3%) protects revenue streams vulnerable to value-based purchasing penalties while enhancing competitive positioning in an increasingly quality-transparent marketplace. The dedicated Code Blue/Day Call team—comprising 1 physician and 1 APP—provides rapid response capabilities without distracting CVICU staff from high-acuity patients, simultaneously supporting GME education requirements and reducing preventable complications that drive excess length of stay and mortality penalties.

This formalized agreement rectifies a significant inequity in the current relationship while securing services HFW has come to depend upon. TPCCC currently deploys 5 physicians and 2 APPs during daytime operations while receiving subsidy for only 2 physicians, creating an unsustainable financial burden that averages $350,000 loss per unsubsidized physician annually. The proposed contract provides appropriate compensation for the Interventional Pulmonary procedures, Lung Nodule Program, enhanced Code Blue coverage, and ECMO program support that TPCCC has historically provided at its own expense—services that would require substantial capital investment and years of development for alternative providers to replicate. The 24/7 intensivist availability model, featuring 3 physicians during weekend daytime and 1 physician during nighttime coverage, aligns with Society of Critical Care Medicine and American Heart Association guidelines for high-intensity cardiac ICU care, demonstrating evidence-based staffing ratios proven to reduce mortality, improve adherence to best practices, and enhance team satisfaction.

The continuity advantage inherent in this partnership cannot be overstated. TPCCC's 48-year relationship with HFW since 1977 represents deep institutional knowledge, integrated clinical systems, and established collaborative relationships across departments that would be impossible for a new provider to replicate quickly or cost-effectively. This proposal transforms an informal, financially strained arrangement into a structured partnership that protects HFW's strategic growth initiatives while ensuring the sustainability of specialized programs that differentiate the hospital in an increasingly competitive North Texas healthcare market. The March 2026 implementation timeline carries zero transition risk—providers are already in place, systems are operational, and relationships are established—making this a financial and contractual formalization rather than a disruptive operational change.

# Experience Snapshot

Texas Pulmonary and Critical Care Consultants brings unparalleled institutional knowledge and proven operational excellence to HFW through a 48-year continuous partnership dating back to 1977. This nearly five-decade relationship demonstrates sustained commitment to HFW's evolving strategic priorities and provides deep understanding of the hospital's culture, clinical workflows, and quality improvement methodologies. While alternative providers might offer competitive pricing, they cannot replicate the institutional trust, established physician relationships, and seamless integration that TPCCC has cultivated over 48 years. This legacy partnership positions TPCCC uniquely to support HFW's ambitious cardiac program expansion without the operational disruption, learning curve, or relationship-building delays inherent in transitioning to a new critical care provider.

TPCCC currently operates a comprehensive critical care service portfolio that extends far beyond basic ICU coverage, supporting HFW's strategic differentiation in the competitive North Texas market. Our integrated team of 5 physicians and 2 APPs delivers closed unit management for both the MICU and CVICU, with specialized expertise in high-acuity cardiac care including ECMO program support, cardiogenic shock management, and mechanical circulatory support. Beyond critical care, TPCCC provides essential value-added services that would require significant time and investment for alternative providers to replicate: Interventional Pulmonary procedures, the established Lung Nodule Program, Code Blue response capabilities, and comprehensive graduate medical education under integrated leadership. This breadth of service delivery under a single contractual relationship streamlines administrative coordination, ensures clinical continuity, and supports multiple HFW strategic initiatives simultaneously—capabilities that represent substantial competitive advantages over providers offering only traditional intensivist coverage.

Our clinical operations align rigorously with national evidence-based standards, specifically the Society of Critical Care Medicine staffing recommendations and American Heart Association guidelines for high-intensity cardiac ICUs. These frameworks, which demonstrate improved mortality outcomes, enhanced adherence to best practices, and reduced physician burnout, guide our staffing ratios and coverage models. TPCCC maintains safe physician-to-patient ratios of 1:7 to 1:14 and APP-to-patient ratios of 1:4 to 1:8, ensuring appropriate clinical oversight for HFW's high-acuity patient population. Our established APP training and development program ensures consistent quality across all critical care extenders through deliberate competency progression protocols and ongoing education, addressing one of the most challenging aspects of ICU staffing—maintaining clinical excellence while scaling coverage to meet growing patient volumes.

TPCCC's commitment to HFW's long-term strategic success is demonstrated through proactive recruitment aligned with the hospital's cardiac program expansion. In August 2026, TPCCC will add a dual-trained cardiologist-intensivist to our HFW team, bringing specialized expertise in cardiogenic shock management and mechanical circulatory support—precisely the clinical capabilities required to support Cardiothoracic Surgery's growing high-risk case volume and advanced cardiac interventions. This strategic recruitment, initiated well in advance of contract finalization, reflects TPCCC's confidence in the partnership's future and our willingness to invest in specialized talent specifically for HFW's benefit. Under the strategic leadership of John Hollingsworth, MD, TPCCC President and project sponsor, our organization provides executive-level collaboration with HFW administration, ensuring alignment between operational delivery and institutional strategic priorities. Dr. Hollingsworth's direct involvement in contract negotiation and ongoing relationship management ensures responsive decision-making and sustained focus on HFW's evolving needs.

Our quality performance track record positions TPCCC to achieve HFW's 6 weighted quality metrics: Excess Days, CLABSI, CAUTI, Mortality, Prolonged Ventilation, and 24-hour Readmissions. We have established improvement methodologies and data-driven protocols that target these specific outcomes, with demonstrated capability to meet the defined performance thresholds. This quality focus, combined with our comprehensive service portfolio, 48-year institutional knowledge, and strategic workforce planning, creates a value proposition that extends far beyond staffing hours—TPCCC serves as HFW's strategic partner in delivering differentiated critical care excellence that supports the hospital's competitive positioning and financial performance in the North Texas healthcare market.

# Proposed Statement of Work

The implementation of this contract enhancement will proceed in three strategic phases, commencing with contract execution in March 2026. The first phase establishes immediate operational transformation by formalizing the existing staffing model into a fully subsidized framework. This includes deployment of 5 subsidized physicians and 5 APPs for weekday daytime coverage, strategically distributed across critical care units: MICU (1 physician), CVICU (1 physician + 2 APPs to support the 21-bed census with ECMO capability), Cardiac PCU C1 (1 physician + 1 APP for the 25-bed high-acuity unit), Pulmonary On-Call (1 physician + 1 APP), and Code Blue/Day Call (1 physician + 1 APP). Nighttime coverage will be established with 2 physicians and 3 APPs on weekdays, while weekend staffing will consist of 3 physicians during daytime hours, 1 physician for nighttime coverage, and 5 APPs distributed across all units to ensure continuous critical care presence. Key deliverables for this initial phase include finalized rounding schedules that eliminate coverage gaps, completion of credentialing processes for all providers, implementation of closed Cardiac PCU (C1) protocols that formalize intensivist leadership for vasopressor-dependent patients, establishment of dedicated Code Blue team operational procedures to eliminate distraction from CVICU APP responsibilities, and documentation of cross-coverage algorithms to ensure seamless care transitions.

Phase 2, spanning months 2 through 6, focuses on quality metric monitoring infrastructure and specialized program integration. TPCCC will deploy real-time dashboards tracking the 6 weighted quality measures that define contract performance: Excess Days O:E (target <1.513), CLABSI (target <0.589), CAUTI (target <0.538), Mortality O:E (target <1.61), Prolonged Ventilation O:E (target <1.0), and 24-hour Readmissions (target <3%), with each metric weighted at 10% for performance-based incentive calculations. Monthly performance reviews with HFW leadership will provide transparent visibility into quality improvement trajectories and enable proactive intervention when metrics trend unfavorably. A critical milestone during this phase is the integration of a dual-trained cardiologist-intensivist in August 2026, enhancing the CVICU model with specialized expertise in cardiogenic shock management, ECMO protocols, and Impella program support—directly addressing the Cardiothoracic Surgery department's request for expanded intensivist presence in high-acuity cardiac cases. Phase 2 deliverables include comprehensive quality metric baseline reports establishing pre-contract performance levels, improvement trajectory projections demonstrating expected outcomes, CVICU protocol optimization documentation, GME education curriculum integration materials, and quarterly volume and acuity analysis reports that correlate staffing models with patient outcomes.

Phase 3, encompassing months 7 through 12, establishes the performance assessment and contract evolution framework that ensures long-term partnership sustainability. This phase implements formal performance-based incentive assessment against the 6 quality metric targets, with each measure contributing equally to the incentive payment calculation. The annual contract review process will evaluate staffing model effectiveness, quality metric achievement, and alignment with HFW's strategic cardiac program growth initiatives. Given the significant expansion from the current $2.4M contract to the proposed $6.9M annual value, this review period is essential for demonstrating return on investment through measurable quality improvements, cost avoidance from reduced complications, and enhanced program support capabilities. Strategic planning for Year 2 adjustments will be informed by actual cardiac program growth patterns, census trends across the 21-bed CVICU, 25-bed Cardiac PCU, and 22-bed MICU, and evolving acuity requirements from expanded ECMO, cardiogenic shock, and Impella programs. Final deliverables include a comprehensive annual performance summary report documenting achievement against all contracted metrics, detailed incentive payment calculations with supporting data, contract adjustment recommendations based on demonstrated value and changing clinical needs, and a recruitment needs assessment to ensure sustained growth support as HFW's cardiac programs continue expanding. This phased approach transforms the current financially unsustainable informal arrangement into a formalized partnership with clear accountability, measurable outcomes, and transparent performance expectations that benefit both organizations.

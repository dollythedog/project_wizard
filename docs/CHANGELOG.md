# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Known Issues (v0.4.1)
- **Planning Parser:** Tasks run together without line breaks in PROJECT_PLAN.md
- **Duration Parsing:** Parenthetical clarifications incorrectly extracted as task durations (e.g., "5 days APP" becomes duration)
- **Dependencies:** Dependencies parsed as tasks instead of separate section
- **Progress Calculation:** Starting a phase gives partial credit even with no work done (70% shown but realistically 50%)
- **Timeline Awareness:** No warning when deadline is imminent

### Planned (v0.4.2)
- Fix task formatting - add line breaks between tasks
- Fix duration parsing - ignore parenthetical clarifications
- Add separate Dependencies section to PROJECT_PLAN.md template
- Add Critical Path section to plan template
- Improve progress calculation accuracy
- Add deadline warning if < 3 days away

### Planned (Future)
- OpenProject sync implementation  
- Project type templates (YAML)
- ISSUES.md ↔ OpenProject bidirectional sync
- Docker deployment
- FastAPI web interface (optional)
- Built-in AI integration (--ai flag)
- PNG icon rendering in terminal (future enhancement)

# Proposal Blueprint Quality Guide

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Updated:** 2025-12-03  
**Purpose:** Prevent bloated, repetitive, hallucinated proposals by enforcing length limits, fact-checking, and section deduplication.

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

**Proposals that work are CLIENT-FOCUSED, not VENDOR-FOCUSED.**

Show you understand THEIR problem first, then propose YOUR solution. Keep it concise—every section must earn its place.

---

## 📏 Target Lengths (ENFORCE STRICTLY)

| Section | Target Words | Target Length | Format |
|---------|--------------|---------------|--------|
| **Cover Letter** | 200–300 | 1 page max | Opening + 3 bullet sections (Client Challenges, Objectives, Qualifications) |
| **Executive Summary** | 150–200 | ½–1 page | 3 paragraphs (Problem, Solution, Why Us) |
| **Key Benefits** | 250–300 | ½ page | 3–4 categories (Clinical, Operational, Financial, Strategic) with 2–3 bullets each |
| **Experience Snapshot** | 200–250 | ½ page | Paragraphs or bullet list (credentials, experience, team) |
| **Statement of Work** | 400–500 | 1–1.5 pages | 3 phases (Mobilization, Delivery, Performance) with activities, deliverables, timeline |
| **Terms & Pricing** | 300–350 | ½–¾ page | 1 pricing table + scope inclusions/exclusions + contract term |
| **Signature Block** | 50–75 | ¼ page | Signatory names and titles |
| **TOTAL DOCUMENT** | **2,500–3,500** | **5–7 pages** | All sections combined |

### ⚠️ Critical Rule
**If document exceeds 8 pages or 4,500 words, CONDENSE immediately.** Prioritize in this order:
1. Client pain points (never cut this)
2. Your solution (never cut this)
3. Measurable benefits (high priority)
4. Clear deliverables (high priority)
5. Experience snapshot (condensable)
6. Terms & pricing (keep clear, but can be concise)

## 🚫 Anti-Hallucination Checklist

### ABSOLUTE PROHIBITIONS

These will destroy credibility. Do NOT do these:

❌ **NEVER invent names of people**
- No "Dr. Emily Johnson" or "Sarah Smith" unless explicitly provided
- No fictional team members

✅ **When names are not provided:**
- Use generic language: "Our team of board-certified intensivists and advanced practice providers brings extensive ICU experience."

---

❌ **NEVER fabricate credentials or titles**
- No invented "FCCP" or "20 years experience" unless stated

✅ **When credentials are not provided:**
- State only what you know: "Our organization was founded in 1998 with expertise in critical care staffing."

---

❌ **NEVER add numbers/metrics not provided**
- No "40% cost reduction" if not in the input
- No "$2.5M savings" if not calculated from provided data
- No "25% reduction in readmissions" if not sourced

✅ **When specific metrics are unknown:**
- Use softer language: "Predictable staffing model reduces variability" instead of inventing a percentage

---

❌ **NEVER create fake past experience**
- No "we managed a 500-bed hospital's ICU" if this wasn't provided

✅ **When past experience is limited:**
- Reference what you DO know: "Our organization operates critical care programs in Texas hospitals" (assuming this is true)

---

### Verification Checklist (USE BEFORE FINALIZING)

Before submitting a proposal, ask:

- [ ] **Names**: Is every person mentioned explicitly provided in the input?
- [ ] **Credentials**: Are all titles/credentials only those explicitly provided?
- [ ] **Numbers**: Is every metric/percentage/dollar amount grounded in provided data?
- [ ] **Experience**: Have I only referenced explicitly provided past work?
- [ ] **Assumptions**: Am I making ANY assumptions? If yes, use generic language instead.

**If ANY checkbox fails → REWRITE using generic language or omit entirely.**

---

## 🎯 Section Deduplication Rules (CRITICAL)

Each section has a **unique purpose**. If you repeat the same information in multiple sections, the proposal becomes bloated and loses credibility.

### Section-by-Section Purpose

| Section | PRIMARY PURPOSE | What Goes Here | What Does NOT Go Here |
|---------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Cover Letter** | Prove you understand THEIR problem | Specific client challenges, your objectives | Solution details, benefits, team pitching |
| **Executive Summary** | Propose YOUR solution and credibility | Problem restatement, solution approach, why your org | Don't repeat cover letter verbatim; don't list benefits |
| **Key Benefits** | Measurable outcomes, not features | 3–4 categories (Clinical/Operational/Financial/Strategic) with specific results | Solution methods, deliverables, team info |
| **Experience Snapshot** | Build confidence in your capability | Years in business, expertise, team credentials (IF PROVIDED), past work (IF PROVIDED) | Repeat value prop; don't describe solution; don't invent names |
| **Statement of Work** | Show HOW to execute (activities, timeline) | Phases, activities, deliverables, timeline, responsible parties | Benefits, outcomes, team credentials |
| **Terms & Pricing** | Define scope boundaries and cost | Pricing table, inclusions, exclusions, contract term | Sales messaging, benefits, deliverables |

### Examples of Violations (❌) vs. Correct (✅)

**Violation: Repeating benefits in Statement of Work**
```
❌ "Phase 2 focuses on providing 24/7 coverage, which will reduce patient variability and improve ICU efficiency."
✅ "Phase 2 includes 24/7 in-house APP presence supported by attending physician oversight, with daily handoffs at 07:00 and 19:00."
```

**Violation: Repeating client problem in Executive Summary**
```
❌ "As discussed in the cover letter, you face significant challenges with locum staffing and coverage gaps. We propose a dedicated staffing model..."
✅ "To address the coverage inconsistency referenced in our cover letter, we propose a dedicated model built on 24/7 in-house staffing with structured handoffs and accountability metrics."
```

**Violation: Inventing experience in Experience Snapshot**
```
❌ "Dr. Sarah Mitchell, our Medical Director, brings 20 years of critical care experience and has led the ICU expansion at three major teaching hospitals."
   (when no Dr. Sarah Mitchell was provided)

✅ "Our organization brings 18 years of experience in critical care staffing and has supported programs in community and academic medical centers across Texas."
   (using only what was actually provided)
```

## 📋 Section-by-Section Guidance

### Cover Letter
**Purpose:** Prove you understand THEIR specific problem.  
**Tone:** Confident, collaborative, forward-looking  
**Length:** 200–300 words, fits on 1 page

**Structure:**
1. Opening (1–2 sentences referencing recent discussion)
2. Client Challenges (3–4 specific bullets from their context)
3. Your Objectives (3–4 bullets showing you understand what they want to achieve)
4. Our Unique Qualifications (3–4 bullets on why you're positioned to help)
5. Closing (1–2 sentences expressing enthusiasm)

**✅ Example:**
> {{Your Company}} proposes to partner with {{Hospital}} to ensure 24/7 critical care coverage. During our recent discussions, we identified three key challenges:
> - Variability in pulmonary coverage with increasing dependence on locum providers
> - Extended response times to ICU consults (currently 45+ minutes)
> - Coordination gaps between ICU and hospitalist teams
>
> Our objectives are to:
> - Provide stable, accountable in-house coverage
> - Reduce consult response time to <30 minutes
> - Integrate seamlessly with your existing workflows
>
> {{Your Company}} is uniquely qualified because we:
> - Operate 8 dedicated critical care programs across the region
> - Employ board-certified intensivists with an average 15+ years experience
> - Use standardized clinical protocols proven to improve outcomes

**❌ Avoid:**
- Generic language ("we have excellent experience")
- Selling language ("we believe this will make you one of the top hospitals")
- Solution details (save for Executive Summary)

---

### Executive Summary
**Purpose:** Explain YOUR solution and why your organization is the logical choice.  
**Tone:** Analytical, evidence-based  
**Length:** 150–200 words, 3 paragraphs

**Paragraph 1 (Client Situation):**
- Restate the problem in 50–60 words
- Add depth (data, context) not in cover letter
- Example: "Your ICU relies on locum coverage for 35% of shifts. This variability increases patient handoff errors by 23% and has contributed to a 0.7-day increase in average LOS."

**Paragraph 2 (Proposed Solution):**
- Describe your model, key components, timeline (50–60 words)
- Example: "We propose 24/7 in-house APP support with attending oversight, daily structured handoffs at 07:00 and 19:00, and a two-tier call escalation system."

**Paragraph 3 (Why Your Organization):**
- Your relevant experience, credentials, integration approach (50–60 words)
- Example: "Our organization has staffed 8 critical care programs for 15+ years. All providers are board-certified intensivists. We integrate with your EMR and quality processes from day one."

**✅ Do:**
- Use specific numbers and data
- Bold key differentiators
- Show how you'll integrate

**❌ Avoid:**
- Repeating cover letter verbatim
- Listing benefits (those go in next section)
- Flowery language

---

### Key Benefits
**Purpose:** Justify the partnership using measurable outcomes, not features.  
**Tone:** Evidence-based and mutually beneficial  
**Length:** 250–300 words

**Format:** 3–4 categories, 2–3 bullets per category

**Categories:**
- **Clinical:** Patient safety, outcomes, quality improvements
- **Operational:** Workflow, efficiency, staffing predictability
- **Financial:** Cost savings, budget predictability
- **Strategic:** Accreditation readiness, growth support

**✅ Good benefit:**
> **Reduced ICU Variability**: Consistent staffing model ensures uniform clinical protocols and reduces day-to-day inconsistency in ventilator management, supporting a projected 10% reduction in average ICU LOS.

**❌ Bad benefit:**
> "Better patient care" or "Improved efficiency" (too vague, not measurable)

**Rule:** Each benefit MUST link directly to a client pain point. Format: `[Outcome]: [Specific metric or result]`

---

### Experience Snapshot
**Purpose:** Build confidence in your capability to deliver.  
**Tone:** Professional, credible, reassuring  
**Length:** 200–250 words

**Elements to Include:**
- Years in business and market presence
- Relevant expertise and specializations
- **Team credentials (ONLY if provided—never invent)**
- **Relevant past experience (ONLY if provided—never invent)**

**⚠️ CRITICAL ANTI-HALLUCINATION RULE:**
Only include names and credentials that are explicitly provided. If no specific team is mentioned, use generic language:

✅ **If team provided:** "Dr. Michael Chen, MD, FCCP, will serve as Medical Director. Dr. Chen brings 18 years of critical care experience and led the ICU transformation at City Hospital (2015–2020)."

✅ **If team NOT provided:** "Our organization employs a team of board-certified intensivists with an average 15+ years of critical care experience. All providers maintain current hospital privileges and professional liability coverage."

❌ **Never do this:** "Dr. Emily Johnson, MD, will lead clinical operations..." (if Emily wasn't mentioned in your input)

---

### Statement of Work
**Purpose:** Demonstrate you know HOW to execute (show the work, not the outcomes).  
**Tone:** Structured, precise, confident  
**Length:** 400–500 words

**Format:** Three phases with activities, deliverables, timelines

**Phase 1: Mobilization & Onboarding (60–90 days)**
- Specific activities (credentialing, EMR setup, policy review)
- Deliverables (privilege confirmation, orientation completion, workflow documentation)
- Timeline (30-day, 60-day milestones)

**Phase 2: Service Delivery (Ongoing)**
- Daily operations (24/7 coverage, handoff process, escalation protocol)
- Key deliverables (monthly performance dashboards, incident reports, quality metrics)
- Responsible parties (Your Org, Hospital, Joint committees)

**Phase 3: Performance Monitoring (Quarterly)**
- Review meetings, data-driven adjustments
- Continuous improvement cycles
- Escalation processes for issues

**✅ Be specific:**
> "Daily handoff occurs at 07:00 and 19:00 with ICU nursing and case management via a structured report template. Emergent consults are seen within 30 minutes via a two-tier call model."

**❌ Avoid vague language:**
> "We will work collaboratively and provide excellent service"

---

### Terms & Pricing
**Purpose:** Define scope boundaries and cost transparently.  
**Tone:** Straightforward, businesslike  
**Length:** 300–350 words (includes table)

**Must Include:**
1. **Pricing Table**—Clear line items (Service/Item, Rate, Notes)
2. **Scope of Services Included**—Bulleted list (what's covered)
3. **Out of Scope**—Bulleted list (what's NOT included)
4. **Contract Term**—Duration, renewal terms
5. **Key Business Terms**—Payment terms, insurance requirements, etc.

**✅ Pricing Table Example:**

| Category | Rate | Notes |
|----------|------|-------|
| 24/7 Coverage | ${{amount}}/month | Includes APP support, attending oversight |
| Admin/QI Time | Included | 4 hours/week |
| Optional Clinic Coverage | ${{amount}}/half-day | Available as needed |

**❌ Avoid:**
- Vague pricing ("we'll discuss later")
- Hidden assumptions
- Lack of clarity on inclusions/exclusions

## 📊 Verification Checklist (Before Finalizing)

Use this checklist before sending any proposal:

### Hallucination Check
- [ ] No fictional people (names, credentials, titles)
- [ ] No invented metrics or percentages
- [ ] No fabricated past experience
- [ ] No assumed data points
- [ ] All claims verifiable from provided inputs

### Length Check
- [ ] Cover letter: 200–300 words
- [ ] Executive summary: 150–200 words
- [ ] Benefits: 250–300 words
- [ ] Experience: 200–250 words
- [ ] SOW: 400–500 words
- [ ] Terms: 300–350 words
- [ ] **Total: 2,500–3,500 words (5–7 pages)**

### Deduplication Check
- [ ] Cover letter talks about THEIR problem (not your solution)
- [ ] Executive summary talks about YOUR solution (not their problem)
- [ ] Benefits are outcomes ONLY (not methods)
- [ ] Experience is credibility ONLY (not value prop)
- [ ] SOW is methods and timeline ONLY (not benefits)
- [ ] Terms is scope and pricing ONLY (no sales messaging)
- [ ] No section repeats another section's content

### Quality Check
- [ ] Professional formatting (bullets, tables, white space)
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3–4 sentences max)
- [ ] Specific language (no vague terms like "excellent" or "significant")
- [ ] Tone is collaborative, not salesy
- [ ] All numbers and data are grounded in provided inputs

---

## 🎓 Why This Matters

Proposals fail because of:
1. **Hallucination** - Invented people, credentials, or data destroys trust
2. **Length** - 16+ page proposals lose readers; administrators read quickly
3. **Repetition** - Covering the same benefits across multiple sections wastes pages and looks unprofessional
4. **Vagueness** - Generic language ("excellent," "significant") lacks persuasive power

This guide prevents all four by enforcing structure, length, fact-checking, and deduplication.
